               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but –

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         – but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         – yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl – the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)
                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?

                                      "PULP FICTION"

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
               seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both 
               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                         – Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause – get a load of 
                         this – if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT
                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES
                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                                     JULES
                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses – nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                         – no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages – I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage – 
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed – this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be –

                                     JULES
                         – I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions –

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black –

                                     JULES
                         – go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald –

                                     JULES
                         – does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                       "VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find – when all 
                         this shit is over and done – I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
                         motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
                         now you got ability. But painful as 
                         it may be, ability don't last. Now 
                         that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
                         life, but it's a fact of life your 
                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you 
                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 
                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Now the night of the fight, you may 
                         fell a slight sting, that's pride 
                         fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 
                         only hurts, it never helps. Fight 
                         through that shit. 'Cause a year

                         "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                     BUTCH
                         I got no problem with that.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

               CLOSEUP – JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

               Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two 
               continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

               CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

               Going into Vincent's vein.

               CLOSEUP – BLOOD

               Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

               CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

               Pushing down on the plunger.

               Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

               The Dusty Springfield song stops.

                         Let's go.

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck is this place?

                                     MIA
                         This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 
                         man should love it.

                                     VINCENT
                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA
                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                                     VINCENT
                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY
                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 
                         or bloody as hell?

                         Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 
                         vanilla coke.

                                     BUDDY

                                     MIA
                         I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger – 
                         bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 
                         Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

                         shake?

                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh.

                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him –

                                     MIA
                         What are you doing?

                         Rollin' a smoke.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it –

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist – when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA
                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding 
                         – then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         ...One lucky couple will win this 
                         handsome trophy that Marilyn here is 
                         holding.

               Marilyn holds the trophy.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         ...Now, who will be our first 
                         contestants?

               Mia holds her hand.

                                     MIA
                         Right here.

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that 
                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         Let's hear it for our first 
                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP – MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                                     PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
                              (on TV)
                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         Lance! The phone's ringing!

                                     LANCE

                         I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna 
                         tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
                              (he answers the phone)
                         Hello, do you know how late it is? 
                         You're not supposed to be callin' me 
                         this fuckin' late.

               VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
               conversation.

                                     VINCENT

                                     VINCENT
                         Negative.

                                     LANCE
                         She ain't my fuckin' problem, you 
                         fucked her up, you deal with it – 
                         are you talkin' to me on a cellular 
                         phone?

                                     VINCENT
                         Sorry.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know you, who is this, don't 
                         come here, I'm hangin' up.

                                     VINCENT
                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What the hell was that?

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia 
               out.

                         Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' 
                         croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But 
                         before he turns me into a bar soap,

                         how you coulda saved her life, but 
                         instead you let her die on your front 
                         lawn.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY
                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY
                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                                     LANCE
                         Get that black box in the bedroom I 
                         have with the adrenaline shot.

                         What's wrong with her?

                                     VINCENT
                         She's ODing on us.

                                     JODY
                         Well get her the hell outta here!

                                     LANCE AND VINCENT
                              (in stereo)
                         Get the fuckin' shot!

                         Don't yell and me!

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                     VINCENT

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What's he lookin' for?

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)
                         What are you lookin' for?

                                     LANCE
                         My black medical book!

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY
                         Whata're you looking for?

                                     LANCE
                         My black fuckin' medical book. It's 
                         like a text book they give to nurses.

                                     JODY
                         I never saw a medical book.

                                     LANCE
                         Trust me, I have one.

                                     JODY
                         Well if it's that important, why 
                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                                     JODY
                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room –

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         – get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                     LANCE
                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                     LANCE
                         It's ready, I'll tell you what to 
                         do.

                                     VINCENT
                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                                     LANCE
                         No, you're gonna give her the shot.

                                     VINCENT
                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE
                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                                     LANCE
                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                                     VINCENT
                         What happens after that?

                                     LANCE
                         I'm curious about that myself.

                                     VINCENT
                         This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

                                     LANCE
                         She's supposed to come out of it 
                         like –
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         – that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                                     VINCENT
                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
               what to expect.

                                     LANCE
                         One...

               RED DOT on Mia's body.

               Needle raised ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)
                         ...two...

               Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

               NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)
                         ...three!

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest – SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                                     LANCE
                         If you're okay, say something.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA
                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                     JODY
                         Anybody want a beer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT
                         What are your thoughts on how to 
                         handle this?

                                     MIA
                         What's yours?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA
                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                                     VINCENT
                         I seriously doubt that.

                                     MIA
                         If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                     VINCENT
                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
               shake and shake they do.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                                     MIA
                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 
                         FIVE" joke?

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT
                         I can't wait.

                                     MIA
                         Three tomatoes are walking down the 
                         street, a poppa tomato, a momma 
                         tomato, and a little baby tomato. 
                         The baby tomato is lagging behind 
                         the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 
                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the 
                         momma tomato and stamps on him –
                              (stamps on the ground)

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE
                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The 
               sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked 
               car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from 
               inside.

                         than I've ever seen a victorious 
                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
                         he knew Willis was dead?

                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I 
                         think any man would've left the ring 
                         that fast.

                         Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 
                         help but shake the world of boxing 
                         to its very foundation. But it's of 
                         paramount importance that during the

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (Spanish accent)
                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Where to?

                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – 
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio – you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man –

                                     BUTCH
                         – I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news – I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese –

                                     BUTCH
                         – where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         –

                                     BUTCH
                         – on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table – on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY – DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA – DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA – DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         –

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me –

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         – hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business –

                                     MAYNARD
                         – I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

               TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask – two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good –

                                     BUTCH
                         – did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk – 
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               TITLE CARD:

                            "JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

               TITLE DISAPPEARS.

               Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)
                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM – DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT – DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand –

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES
                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules –

                                     JULES
                         – I said don't do that –

                                     VINCENT
                         – you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time –

                                     VINCENT
                         – chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight –

                                     VINCENT
                         – I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT
                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES
                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES
                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JIMMIE
                         – I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

                                     JIMMIE
                         – answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                         – I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation – 
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie –

                                     JIMMIE
                         – don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery – now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie – 
                         lead the way, boys – get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE – MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES
                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON
                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT
                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES
                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ –

                                     VINCENT
                         – what happened was peculiar – no 
                         doubt about it – but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all –

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
                         general principle.

                                     JULES
                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
               – wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY
                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL
                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY
                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL
                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY
                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

                               MABEL
                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY
                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
 
                               MABEL
                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY
                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL
                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY
                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL
                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL
                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY
                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

                               EARL
                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY
                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

                               OTIS
                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY
                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

                               SONNY
                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL
                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY
                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY
                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS
                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY
                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY
                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY
                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL
                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY
                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.
                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a
                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Dewight McClusky of the California
                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

                               MCCLUSKY
                         (referring to book)
                    This is damn good reading. I'm
                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've been separated since their
                    incarceration in a couple of
                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've killed a shitload of inmates
                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Five inmates, eight guards and one
                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...
                    Very good. You do keep up with the
                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will
                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of
                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'
                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'
                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    So can we. So the solution to our
                    little problem is we had them deemed
                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The public loves you Jack...You don't
                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
                    years on the force, a best-seller out on
                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a breathing icon of justice and
                    that's why you were chosen to deliver
                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
                    board we, knows that once you get them
                    on the road if anything should happen,
                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
                    would be there to look out for his
                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You write the script Jack, call it,
                    'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
                    years with the penal institution, and
                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,
                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group
                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
                    just how fucked up our system really
                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Who's the song bird?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
                    Knox. This little lady drowned her
                    father in a fish tank.

     INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

                               MCCLUSKY
                    While the two together burned her
                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Because they wouldn't give them their
                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
                    When pressed about the reason for the
                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY
                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your
                    entertainment. If I don't tell you
                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
                    give me some more time? I've already
                    got life. What else you got to
                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Here she is...you know her, you
                    love her, you can't live without
                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at
                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Been workin' on the road now.
                    Been workin' by the sea.
                    Been workin' in the cane fields.
                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Don't worry about it. She does that
                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the
                    prison board, but it's like pullin'
                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The only reason I'm here now is to set
                    him straight, and I'm on the next
                    flight out.
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the
                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER
                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on
                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thanks.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with
                    Phil. He can answer all the questions
                    you got about the arrangements. I'm
                    gonna be bidding you good luck and
                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My
                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER
                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
                    together. So, we'll put you on one of
                    our prison busses and you'll take
                    Mallory first, then you'll come back
                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
                    darkest cell in the whole place. But
                    it just so happens that right now he's
                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who?

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (surprised)
                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE
                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                         (to himself)
                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello Mickey. We've never been
                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
                    don't know if you've ever heard of me
                    or remember me. I was one of the
                    reporters outside the courthouse during
                    your trial---

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody knows who you are. You're
                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE
                    I could say the same thing about you.
                         (smiles)
                    I want to thank you very much for
                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE
                    I have a television show. It's very
                    popular. Every week we do a profile on
                    a different serial killer. You don't
                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do
                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE
                    The episode we did on Mickey and
                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               MICKEY
                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE
                    Yours.

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
                    him?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY
                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE
                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE
                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
                    king.

                               WAYNE
                    We've been waiting to do a follow up
                    episode on you for a long time. And
                    that time has definitely come.
                         (pause)
                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY
                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE
                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY
                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE
                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY
                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE
                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE
                         (yells after him)
                    Just think about it. But don't think
                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
                    At night I get the chills. I pretend
                    you're lying next to me, holding me
                    from behind with your leg draped over
                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly
                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not
                    making love, just kissing for hours and
                    hours on end. I remember everything
                    about our time. I remember every joke
                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    I remember every secret you ever
                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think
                    shared is proper. I remember every
                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I
                    remember your cooking. I especially
                    remember your casseroles. I remember
                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember driving fast...faster,
                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

                                                  CUT TO:

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
                    up on the dash, singing along with the
                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of
                    Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary
                    Goes', 'Groove Me'...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the
     drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on
     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,
                    every minute of our happiness. Every
                    day take a day of our time and go
                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump
                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,
                    and I live that day again. That way
                    when I get to our first kiss...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear
     in the flame kissing passionately.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    The killing of your parents, our
                    wedding...They're not just memories.
                    I feel that joy again...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE
                         (reading out loud)
                    'After taking a few days to reflect on
                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion
                    that you are one hundred percent
                    correct. A national TV interview would
                    be very advantageous to both Mallory
                    and I. The only obstacle is they're
                    shipping me out to the funny farm in
                    four days. However, that is your
                    problem and not mine. I feel confident
                    you'll manage. Here's to us making
                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey
                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE
                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE
                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This
                    is the day we received word we were
                    gonna make television history. We're
                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth
                    interview with the most charismatic
                    serial killer ever, one day before he's
                    being shipped to a mental hospital for
                    the rest of his life. This is one of
                    those golden moments that happens maybe
                    only four times in a lucky journalist's
                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
                    this is Elton John confessing his
                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
                    is the tearful reporting of the
                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
                    setting the record straight on
                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
                    Deep Throat in an underground parking
                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
                    State, the Maysles brothers at
                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
                    interviews...

                               ROGER
                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT
                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE
                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
                    shit together. The day after that
                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT
                    Would the network really not run it
                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The last thing they
                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up
                    close and personal. They wanted a
                    follow up episode and would've taken
                    anything I had given them. I'm not
                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
                    make him think his grey matter depends
                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass
                    about this coup, they practically shit
                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
                    They want to expand the show to a hour,
                    and they want it on immediately.

                    Rape and pillage the first episode,
                    just change the order a bit. Those
                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
                    know the difference. All that shit is
                    just filler for the interview anyway.
                    We film a new intro. Show some old
                    footage from the first episode so the
                    get a brief history of Mickey and
                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
                    what the prison board is up to. We
                    see some of that new shit, then the
                    rest of the show is the interview. Now
                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'

                    we got. Get it into shape so when we

                    At that point I'll ask him if he
                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
                    ask him what he thinks God would make
                    of his actions. And is he worried
                    about burning in hell? If he says no,
                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
                    something like a live round of ammo,
                    the expression on the face of a man he
                    just split up the middle, Mallory's

                    He's bound to say something
                    provocative.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and
     Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and
     looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,

                               SCOTT
                    Well, basically, what we did was put
                    part of the old show on first...

                               ROGER
                    But we changed the order around so it
                    wasn't super obvious...

                    Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
                    mayhem.

     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

                    ...As spectators, reporters, law

                    interested, the curious, the devoted,

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
                    trial was so event filled it made the
                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's
                    performance would be.

     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

     Wayne interviews JUDGE BURT STEINSMA in his den at home.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
                    the presiding judge during the Knox
                    trial.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

     INT. WANDA BISBING'S OFFICE - DAY

     Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive
     woman in her forties.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    However, this opinion isn't shared by
                    the state's prosecutor on this case,
                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

                               WAYNE
                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING
                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,
                    which I did.

                    Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory

                    Mickey's talent as a defence attorney
                    became apparent.
                    Law students from all ends of the
                    country converged on Los Angeles as
                    legal history took a new course. But
                    that was only the lemon next to the
                    pie. And that pie is you, the American

                    mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey
                    and Mallory have captured the public's

                    admiration.

                               NORMAN
                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
                    standing in a dark room waiting for the
                    other to attack. These two people
                    can't see each other, yet they know
                    they're there. Now, they can either
                    stand in the dark room forever waiting
                    until they die of boredom, or one of
                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    Why can't they just shake hands and be
                    friends?

                               NORMAN
                    They can't because neither knows if the
                    other is a deranged senseless killer
                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN
                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON
                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.
                    Probably the whole city. They gave us
                    the fighting spirit. Before this

                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
                    to work like the devil to get whole
                    again.

                               WAYNE
                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON
                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN
                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON
                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN
                    They're shocking the world into
                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON
                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE
                    One last question. Usually Mickey and
                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN
                    They had us tied down during one of
                    their house raids, you've seen the
                    headlines, and they were taking a
                    chainsaw to our legs before they were
                    gonna kill us.

                               SIMON
                    Just for fun, I guess.

                               NORMAN
                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON
                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN
                    Apparently, they've seen all our films.

                               SIMON
                    They were especially influenced by
                    'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

                               NORMAN
                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
                    off.

                               SIMON
                    They actually apologized.

                    The couple proved so popular that a

                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
                    director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
                    take on the Mickey and Mallory
                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE
                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
                    want to. If I could, I would, but I
                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and
                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I don't give a damn if a million United
                    States marines, all whistling the halls
                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
                    down this alley any second. There
                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
                    they'll catch me and take me to the
                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
                    you. I could bear anything, but I
                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,
                    for me, my handsome
                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when
                    his partner can't run with him.
                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                         (to himself)
                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Mallory!

                                                    CUT TO:

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE
                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE
                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY
                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY
                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
                    But I read some letters she wrote to
                    Mickey before the murder spree. They
                    helped me out a lot.

                    You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?

                               JESSIE
                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for
                    my taste, but all in all, we got along.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE
                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

     MULBERRY. CAMERA moves in CU of the photo.

                    Of the six teens murdered that night,
                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.
                    And this haunted young lady summoned up
                    the courage to take the stand, tell
                    what she saw that horrible night, and
                    then allow herself to be cross-examined
                    by the man who killed her brother and
                    girlfriends.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media
     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

                    examining you?

     Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
     crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
     hear the cry of:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mickey and Mallory!

     CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
     and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
     faces.

     Mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t-shirt,
     which is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and
     he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with

                               MICKEY
                    When you study the martial arts, they
                    give out belts that come in different
                    colors to signify what level you're at
                    in your training. Am I correct on that
                    point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes you are.

                               MICKEY
                    What was the color of Tim's belt?

                               GRACE
                    The style of fighting that Tim studied
                    didn't believe in belts.

                               MICKEY
                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
                    could you tell us what form of martial
                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE
                    Tim studied several styles, but his
                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY
                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
                    on that form of fighting, and I found
                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
                    that?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
                    style.

     CU of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, while I freely admit total
                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard
                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of
                    the, if not the greatest fighter in the
                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE
                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY
                    So, I think it would be safe to say
                    that anybody who studied the fighting
                    style that Bruce Lee, arguably the
                    greatest martial artist of all times,
                    developed for nine years, that would be
                    a fella who could defend himself.
                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I would.

                               MICKEY

                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               MICKEY
                    That means his hands are considered a
                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
                    correct on that point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, you are.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did
                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE
                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

                    The sentence was never to reach that
                    point. Because after only a year,
                    Mickey and Mallory created so much
                    mayhem that it was decided...

                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,
                    chairman of the California State Prison
                    Board, about this curious turn of
                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

     INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

                               WAYNE
                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE
                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE
                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

                               WAYNE
                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

                               WAYNE
                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE
                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

                    No...please...thank you...you're
                    too kind...no...please...

     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY

     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -
     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are
     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise
     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

                               WAYNE
                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER
                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER
                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER
                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE
                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER
                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE
                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER
                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER
                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER
                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER
                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE
                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER
                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE
                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

                               WAYNE
                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE
                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE
                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE
                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER
                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

                               WAYNE
                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE
                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER
                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE
                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER
                    I see.

                               WAYNE
                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER
                         (proudly)
                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE
                         (acting surprised)
                    Really?

                               WURLITZER
                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE
                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE
                    See what I mean? It's a funny
                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER
                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE
                    They got a asshole over here.
                         (pointing to his left)
                    A asshole sitting down reading a
                    magazine over there.
                         (points to his right)
                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE
                    That's why my crew is only three...an
                    invisible three.
                         (switching gears)
                    Which brings me to what I wanted to
                    talk to you about. I have to get
                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                         (snorts)
                    Well, just what the hell do you expect
                    me to do?

                               WAYNE
                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER
                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE
                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER
                    Since he and his wife have been in
                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE
                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
                    obviously don't know. If I were to
                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would
                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE
                    One...I can take care of myself. I
                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
                    I've handled some pretty rough
                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take
                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.
                         (pause)
                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
                    advisory relationship here, which is
                    not what I want.
                         (pause)
                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE
                         (counting)
                    We got one...two...three...four
                    ...five...six...seven...eight.
                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE
                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
                    up on me with all these sheriffs all
                    over the place. They hate him. He
                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
                    gonna create with all this hate in the
                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER
                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE
                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE
                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
                    guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE
                    Three.

                               WURLITZER
                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1
                    On your feet! Turn your face to the
                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY
                    Now what you're supposed to say is:
                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm
                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
                    I'm in and out. You, on the other
                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
                    rest of your life there. Now that's
                    what I call cruel and inhuman
                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.
                    'Cause when the good doctor's get
                    through givin' you the zap...
                         (he puts his finger next
                         to his temple, pantomimes
                         being electrocuted)
                    ...You won't know where the hell you
                    are. They'll just put you on a window
                    sill, and water you every other day.
                       
     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n
                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike
                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't
                    want you talking to him. I don't want
                    you getting in his face. I want you
                    hiding behind your gear. You are
                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Wayne)
                    Okay now, before we get started here,
                    there's a few things we have to get
                    clear about.

                               WAYNE
                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM
                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM
                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I was reading the file on you. You
                    know what it said during your
                    trial, whenever they put you on the
                    stand, no matter what they asked, your
                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
                    that the attraction? Or does he just
                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
                    close your eyes and remember...
                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
                    ever forget it cause it ain't never
                    gonna happen again. Cause when they
                    get through with all that electroshock
                    shit they got lined up for you two,
                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a
                    couple hours while I finish up the
                    arrangements. The reason they picked
                    me to be your chaperone is they know I
                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.
                     
     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, during our journey, if any wild
                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
                    gonna get accidentally shot!
                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (blood down his face)
                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON
                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER
                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY
                         (repulsed)
                    Oh my God!
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE
                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER
                    And me.

                               WAYNE
                    Why don't we make it three deputies and
                    you?

                               WURLITZER
                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
                    into his cell and we can forget the
                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE
                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
                    you, I can live with that. We're about
                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of
                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER
                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE
                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I
                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
     a light stand.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
                    these assholes. Now I want to create
                    the illusion that this is just Mickey
                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
                    So make sure you don't film these
                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
                    slated our spot as human interest which
                    means we'll go live at just after
                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if
                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be
                    responsible, we are. So keep your
                    shotguns out, your fingers on the
                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a
                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER
                    Say something.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    What?

                               ROGER
                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY
                         (talking in rhyme)
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf tormented shore,
                    As I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep--while I weep!
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER
                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
                    donut place put a chocolate cream
                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY
                    There's a chocolate cream filled in
                    there?

                               ROGER
                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY
                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER
                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering
                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER
                         (to himself)
                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
                    doing? You're bothering the serial
                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY
                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE
                    We're about ready to go here. Are you
                    ready?

                               MICKEY
                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay people! Let's start to settle
                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
     FRAME.

                               WAYNE
                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
                    fun.

                               MICKEY
                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE
                         (not amused)
                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
                    fun?
                         (to people O.S.)
                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
                         (to camera)
                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really
                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY
                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
                    Do you want to know what I do for fun
                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE
                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
                    for starters.

                               MICKEY
                    What I did for fun for starters.
                         (thinking)
                    Well, something I used to do...always
                    was a lot of fun...
                         (pause)
                    No, scratch that. Let me think of
                    something else. In fact, why don't we
                    come back to that question. Ask me
                    something else.

                               WAYNE
                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY
                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long
                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE
                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE
                    Was massacring all those people worth
                    being separated from your wife for the
                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you think up these questions or the
                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE
                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
                    with that shit. Answer the question.
                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was an instant of purity worth a
                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE
                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of
                    purity? What was the instant of
                    purity? The bodies you left behind on
                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY
                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
                    big, big, big part. But it's only the
                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE
                         (passionately)
                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
                    the purity that you couldn't live
                    without in five year old Danny
                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
                    the purity in forty-eight people who
                    are no longer on this planet because
                    they met you and Mallory? What's so
                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Love is a hurtin' thang,
                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
     film.

                               WAYNE
                    You just said an instant of purity was
                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
                    understand. What's so pure about
                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY
                    You'll never understand. Me and you,
                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.
                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.
                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE
                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughing)
                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
                    a smoke only get you so far. You're
                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE
                         (laughs)
                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY
                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE
                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE
                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
                         (points at his head)
                    What's up here?
                         (points at his heart)
                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY
                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE
                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
                    you feel about the fact that you're
                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY
                         (smiles)
                    Says who?

                               WAYNE
                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughs)
                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY
                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY
                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.
                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (whispers)
                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER
                         (whispers)
                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER
                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You should see the other bitch. What
                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER
                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY
                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE
                         (to Scott)
                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT
                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE
                    Super cool.
                         (to Mickey)
                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY
                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm not running out and getting that
                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                    Fine.
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?
                         (to the room)
                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a
                    block away on Olive. It's walking
                    distance.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
                    I'll have a double double with cheese,
                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER
                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER
                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington
                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER
                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
                    there for when ya need 'em. Where
                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER
                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER
                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER
                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into phone)
                    Talk to me.
                         (pause)
                    Where?
                         (pause)
                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay
                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,
                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Jack, could you stay up here for a
                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Stay up here and finish your interview,
                    I've got to see what the hell's going
                    on down there before I can take
                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
     notebook.

                               MICKEY
                    I'll have a four by four. That's four
                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Sure.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY
                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
                    movie.' The mother tells her she can
                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with
                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY
                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY
                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY
                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY
                         (dumbfounded)
                    'They took off their clothes? What
                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY
                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into

                               MICKEY
                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your
                    hands behind your head, put your
                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I've never wounded anything in my life.
                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY
                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
                    you in half on three. So, if you got
                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

     CU of barrel of shotgun.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

     ECU on Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY
                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY
                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
     facing each other.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER
                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY
                    I am the most dangerous man in the
                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY
                         (points at Scagnetti)
                    You're the law.
                         (points at himself)
                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY
                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's
                    broke.

                               WAYNE
                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY
                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
                    play follow the leader, shut up and do
                    as you're told.


     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY
                    How is it?

                               ROGER
                    Not good.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER
                    It's video.

                               MICKEY
                    Even better. Wayne call your station,
                    tell 'em we're going live a little
                    early today. Make it happen!

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the
     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER
                    I want two men stationed in that tier,
                    and I want men with rifles all along
                    the walkway.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER
                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Problem is they'll hear somebody
                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    We turned off the power when they took
                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER
                    We turn it back on. The machines go
                    back on supplying us with the cover
                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER
                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    I think--

                               WURLITZER
                    Never say you think when you know, or
                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Bergman, you in place?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Pass this to your team...the second
                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to
                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you think, Pitney? How much
                    Explosives do you think that they
                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER
                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    That's my opinion.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jesus...

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY
                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have
                    just tuned in, it appears that a
                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox
                    is developing presently at the Los
                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that
                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY
                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY
                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY
                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                               MICKEY
                    You ready, Donut?

                               ROGER
                    Ready.

                               MICKEY
                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to
     herself, and doing the hand motions.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha
                    dodaleedo, dodaleedo.
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha
                    dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing
                    there isn't much to it.
                    All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I
                    like the rest,
                    but the best part I like is
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo,
                    dodaleedo, do
                    quack, quack.

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

                               MALLORY
                         (in between kisses)
                    It's taken you so long to come to me.

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     A sheet of paper flashes through FRAME.

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the list of the rioters.

     CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the
                    list of the hostages?

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    I'm working on it Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Keep on it, son.

     Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.

                               WURLITZER
                         (reading the names)
                    Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,
                    Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,
                    Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

     Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with
     his hands.

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.

                               WURLITZER
                    What is it Napalatoni?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Mickey Knox is loose.

     Wurlitzer looks up.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you mean he's loose?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    He's armed, he's killed three deputies
                    and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the
                    moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox
                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
                    other deputies as hostages. And
                    Capt'n, they have one of them news
                    cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't
                    stop playin' it. What do you want us
                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
     would come out. He just sits.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, we're going out that door, and
                    we're gonna march down the hall and
                    right out of the building.
                         (to Wayne)
                    Donut said something about a news van.

                               WAYNE
                    Yeah, we have a van.

                               MICKEY
                    Where's it parked?

                               WAYNE
                    Out front.

                               MICKEY
                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY
                    No.

                               WAYNE
                    This is crazy. You can't escape like
                    this.

                               MICKEY
                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it
                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE
                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY
                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, when we get out there, you do what
                    we say or it's curtains. If we say
                    move, you move. If we say left, you
                    move left. If we say right, you move
                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
                    Got it?

                               MALLORY
                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY
                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY
                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY
                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY
                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and
                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?
                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY
                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't
                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                               MALLORY
                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY
                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Man, oh, man...this is better than
                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN
                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Get the camera! Get the fucking
                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

                               MICKEY
                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN
                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY
                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY
                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER
                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY
                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER
                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY
                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY
                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY
                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY
                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY
                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY
                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY
                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You married?

                               DUNCAN
                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY
                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY
                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way
                    to the front door. Now, the only way
                    we're gonna get there is if they don't
                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE
                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY
                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY
                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY
                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE
                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY
                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.
                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody
                    puts me in danger, my network will sue
                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                    Department. My estate will sue every
                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

                               MALLORY
                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER
                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY
                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER
                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY
                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY
                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY
                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE
                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE
                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY
                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY
                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you have anything to do with the
                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY
                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY
                    We had nothing to do with that riot.
                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY
                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY
                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit
                    about and riot. It just happened. It
                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY
                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY
                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

                               MALLORY
                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE
                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY
                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY
                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY
                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE
                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY
                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY
                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY
                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE
                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.

                                    Quentin Tarantino

                                       Final Draft

                

               INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

               Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a 
               breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE, MR. 
               BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT, and the 
               big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and are enjoying 
               coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a small address 
               book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about 
               Madonna.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         "Like a Virgin" is all about a girl 
                         who digs a guy with a big dick. The 
                         whole song is a metaphor for big 
                         dicks.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         No it's not. It's about a girl who 
                         is very vulnerable and she's been 
                         fucked over a few times. Then she 
                         meets some guy who's really sensitive -

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Whoa... whoa... time out Greenbay. 
                         Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

                                     JOE
                              (looking through his 
                              address book)
                         Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... 
                         Toby... think... think... think...

                                     MR. BROWN
                         It's not about a nice girl who meets 
                         a sensitive boy. Now granted that's 
                         what "True Blue" is about, no argument 
                         about that.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Which one is "True Blue?"

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         You don't remember "True Blue?" That 
                         was a big ass hit for Madonna. Shit, 
                         I don't even follow this Tops In 
                         Pops shit, and I've at least heard 
                         of "True Blue."

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't 
                         heard of it. All I asked was how 
                         does it go? Excuse me for not being 
                         the world's biggest Madonna fan.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I hate Madonna.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         I like her early stuff. You know, 
                         "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but 
                         once she got into her "Papa Don't 
                         Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned 
                         out.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a 
                         point here. You're gonna make me 
                         lose my train of thought.

                                     JOE
                         Oh fuck, Toby's that little china 
                         girl.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's that?

                                     JOE
                         I found this old address book in a 
                         jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. 
                         Toby what? What the fuck was her 
                         last name?

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Where was I?

                                     MR. PINK
                         You said "True Blue" was about a 
                         nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. 
                         But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor 
                         for big dicks.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s 
                         about. It's about some cooze who's a 
                         regular fuck machine. I mean all the 
                         time, morning, day, night, afternoon, 
                         dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, 
                         dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         How many dicks was that?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         A lot.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Then one day she meets a John Holmes 
                         motherfucker, and it's like, whoa 
                         baby. This mother fucker's like 
                         Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." 
                         He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's 
                         gettin' this serious dick action, 
                         she's feelin' something she ain't 
                         felt since forever. Pain.

                                     JOE
                         Chew? Toby Chew? No.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't 
                         hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum 
                         by now. But when this cat fucks her, 
                         it hurts. It hurts like the first 
                         time. The pain is reminding a fuck 
                         machine what is was like to be a 
                         virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."

               The fellas crack up.

                                     JOE
                         Wong?

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the 
                         fuck do you know about it anyway? 
                         You're still listening to Jerry-
                         fucking-Vale.

                                     JOE
                         Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, 
                         like the Chinese name?

               Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They 
               fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Give me this fucking thing.

                                     JOE
                         What the fuck do you think you're 
                         doin'? Give me my book back!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; 
                         I'll give it back when we leave.

                                     JOE
                         Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we 
                         leave, give it back now.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For the past fifteen minutes now, 
                         you've just been droning on with 
                         names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby 
                         Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... 
                         fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's 
                         big dick outta my right ear, and 
                         Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my 
                         left.

                                     JOE
                         What do you care?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         When you're annoying as hell, I care 
                         a lot.

                                     JOE
                         Give me my book.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You gonna put it away?

                                     JOE
                         I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do 
                         with it.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna 
                         have to keep it.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Joe, you want me to shoot him for 
                         you?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you 
                         better wake up and apologize.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Have you guys been listening to K-
                         BILLY's super sounds of the seventies 
                         weekend?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Can you believe the songs they been 
                         playin'?

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, I can't. You know what I heard 
                         the other day? "Heartbeat-It's 
                         Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco 
                         and the DeFranco Family. I haven't 
                         heard that since I was in fifth 
                         fuckin' grade.

                         When I was coming down here, I was 
                         playin' it. And "The Night the Lights 
                         Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I 
                         ain't heard that song since it was 
                         big, but when it was big, I heard it 
                         a million-trillion times. I'm 
                         listening to it this morning, and 
                         this was the first time I ever 
                         realized that the lady singing the 
                         song, was the one who killed Andy.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed 
                         the guy?

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         They say it in the song.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I know, I heard it. I musta zoned 
                         out whenever that part came on before. 
                         I thought when she said that little 
                         sister stuff, she was talkin' about 
                         her sister-in-law, the cheatin' wife.

                                     JOE
                         No, she did it. She killed the 
                         cheatin' wife, too.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who gives a damn?

               The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She 
               has the check, and a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody more coffee.

                                     JOE
                         No, we're gonna be hittin' it. I'll 
                         take care of the check.

               She hands the bill to him.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Here ya go. Please pay at the 
                         register, if you wouldn't mind.

                                     JOE
                         Sure thing.

                                     WAITRESS
                         You guys have a wonderful day.

               They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.

                                     JOE
                         I'll take care of this, you guys 
                         leave the tip.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         And when I come back, I want my book 
                         back.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Sorry, it's my book now.

                                     JOE
                         Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, 
                         will ya?

               Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr. White acts 
               shot. Joe exits.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Okay, everybody cough up green for 
                         the little lady.

               Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. 
               Everybody, that is, except Mr. Pink.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         C'mon, throw in a buck.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Uh-uh. I don't tip.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't believe in it.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         You don't believe in tipping?

                                     MR. BROWN
                              (laughing)
                         I love this guy, he's a madman, this 
                         guy.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Do you have any idea what these ladies 
                         make? They make shit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Don't give me that. She don't make 
                         enough money, she can quit.

               Everybody laughs.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I don't even know a Jew who'd have 
                         the balls to say that. So let's get 
                         this straight. You never ever tip?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't tip because society says I 
                         gotta. I tip when somebody deserves 
                         a tip. When somebody really puts 
                         forth an effort, they deserve a little 
                         something extra. But this tipping 
                         automatically, that shit's for the 
                         birds. As far as I'm concerned, 
                         they're just doin' their job.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         Our girl was nice.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Our girl was okay. She didn't do 
                         anything special.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         What's something special, take ya in 
                         the kitchen and suck your dick?

               They all laugh.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I'd go over twelve percent for that.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've 
                         been here a long fuckin' time, and 
                         she's only filled my cup three times. 
                         When I order coffee, I want it filled 
                         six times.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What if she's too busy?

                                     MR. PINK
                         The words "too busy" shouldn't be in 
                         a waitress's vocabulary.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last 
                         thing you need is another cup of 
                         coffee.

               They all laugh.

                                     MR. PINK
                         These ladies aren't starvin' to death. 
                         They make minimum wage. When I worked 
                         for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky 
                         enough to have a job that society 
                         deemed tipworthy.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Ahh, now we're getting down to it. 
                         It's not just that he's a cheap 
                         bastard -

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         It is that too -

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         It is that too. But it's also he 
                         couldn't get a waiter job. You talk 
                         like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck 
                         those cunts and their fucking tips."

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         So you don't care that they're 
                         counting on your tip to live?

               Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Do you know what this is? It's the 
                         world's smallest violin, playing 
                         just for the waitresses.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You don't have any idea what you're 
                         talking about. These people bust 
                         their ass. This is a hard job.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So's working at McDonald's, but you 
                         don't feel the need to tip them. 
                         They're servin' ya food, you should 
                         tip em. But no, society says tip 
                         these guys over here, but not those 
                         guys over there. That's bullshit.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         They work harder than the kids at 
                         McDonald's.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning 
                         fryers.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         These people are taxed on the tips 
                         they make. When you stiff 'em, you 
                         cost them money.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Waitressing is the number one 
                         occupation for female non-college 
                         graduates in this country. It's the 
                         one job basically any woman can get, 
                         and make a living on. The reason is 
                         because of tips.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck all that.

               They all laugh.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Hey, I'm very sorry that the 
                         government taxes their tips. That's 
                         fucked up. But that ain't my fault. 
                         it would appear that waitresses are 
                         just one of the many groups the 
                         government fucks in the ass on a 
                         regular basis. You show me a paper 
                         says the government shouldn't do 
                         that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote, 
                         I'll vote for it. But what I don't 
                         do is play ball. And this non-college 
                         bullshit you're telling me, I got 
                         two words for that: "Learn to fuckin' 
                         type." Cause if you're expecting me 
                         to help out with the rent, you're in 
                         for a big fuckin' surprise.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He's convinced me. Give me my dollar 
                         back.

               Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.

                                     JOE
                         Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. 
                         Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Mr. Pink.

                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Mr. Pink?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Why?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He don't tip.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         He don't tip?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You don't tip? Why?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He don't believe in it.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         He don't believe in it?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You don't believe in it?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Nope.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Shut up!
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, 
                         I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Because you paid for the breakfast, 
                         I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

                                     JOE
                         Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, 
                         and let's move.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         See what I'm dealing with here. 
                         Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with 
                         infants.

               The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in the 
               F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying 
               a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst 
               themselves.

               EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

               CREDIT SEQUENCE

               When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:

               Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in 
               agony.

               Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS, 
               through traffic.

               Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY 
               ELSE SAY:

                                     SOMEBODY ELSE (O.S.)
                         Just hold on buddy boy.

               Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

                                     SOMEBODY (O.S.)
                         I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed 
                         me. Who would've fuckin' thought 
                         that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the backseat. 
               He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both him and the 
               backseat.

               Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of the 
               getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of 
               traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking 
               to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

               They are the only two in the car.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Hey, just cancel that shit right 
                         now! You're hurt. You're hurt really 
                         fucking bad, but you ain't dying.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (crying)
                         All this blood is scaring the shit 
                         outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you 
                         had a degree in medicine. Are you a 
                         doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me 
                         please, are you a doctor?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         No, I'm not!

                                     MR. WRITE
                         Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know 
                         what you're talking about. So if 
                         you're through giving me your amateur 
                         opinion, lie back and listen to the 
                         news. I'm taking you back to the 
                         rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a 
                         doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you 
                         up, and you're gonna be okay. Now 
                         say it: You're gonna be okay. Say 
                         it: You're gonna be okay!

               Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on the 
               steering wheel.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna 
                         be okay!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm okay.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (softly)
                         Correct.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the 
               door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of 
               Mr. Orange inside.

               Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

               Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and 
                         wait for Joe. I can't do anything 
                         for you, but when Joe gets here, 
                         which should be anytime now, he'll 
                         be able to help you. We're just gonna 
                         sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are 
                         we waiting for?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Joe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Bet your sweet ass we are.

               Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl 
               around the warehouse.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (yelling)
                         Don't leave me!

               Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I ain't going anywhere. I'm right 
                         here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Larry, I'm so scared, would you please 
                         hold me.

               Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange. Cradling 
               the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (whispering)
                         Go ahead and be scared, you've been 
                         brave enough for one day. I want you 
                         to just relax now. You're not gonna 
                         die, you're gonna be fine. When Joe 
                         gets here, he'll make ya a hundred 
                         percent again.

               Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's 
               still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the 
                         ointment, but if help doesn't come 
                         soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't 
                         give a fuck about jail, I just don't 
                         wanna die.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You're not gonna fucking die, all 
                         right?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, 
                         and I'm hurt bad.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         It's not good...

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Hey, bless your heart for what you're 
                         trying to do. I was panicking for a 
                         moment, but I've got my senses back 
                         now. The situation is, I'm shot in 
                         the belly. And without medical 
                         attention, I'm gonna die.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I can' take you to a hospital.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about 
                         jail. But I can't die. You don't 
                         have to take me in. Just drive me up 
                         to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. 
                         I'll take care of myself. I won't 
                         tell them anything. I swear to fucking 
                         god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look 
                         in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
                              (Mr. White does)
                         I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll 
                         be safe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Lie back down, and try to -

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm going to die! I need a doctor! 
                         I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.

               Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from 
               his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Take me to a doctor, take me to a 
                         doctor, please.

               Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps 
               inside.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Was that a fucking set-up or what?

               Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

               Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Gun shot.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh that's just fucking great! Where's 
                         Brown?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Dead.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How the fuck do you think? The cops 
                         shot him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Orange)
                         Is it bad?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         As opposed to good?

                                     MR. PINK
                         This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked 
                         us big time.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You really think we were set up?

                                     MR. PINK
                         You even doubt it? I don't think we 
                         got set up, I know we got set up! I 
                         mean really, seriously, where did 
                         all those cops come from, huh? One 
                         minute they're not there, the next 
                         minute they're there. I didn't hear 
                         any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. 
                         Okay, when an alarm goes off, you 
                         got an average of four minutes 
                         response time. Unless a patrol car 
                         is cruising that street, at that 
                         particular moment, you got four 
                         minutes before they can realistically 
                         respond. In one minute there were 
                         seventeen blue boys out there. All 
                         loaded for bear, all knowing exactly 
                         what the fuck they were doing, and 
                         they were all just there! Remember 
                         that second wave that showed up in 
                         the cars? Those were the ones 
                         responding to the alarm. But those 
                         other motherfuckers were already 
                         there, they were waiting for us.
                              (pause)
                         You haven't thought about this?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I haven't had a chance to think. 
                         First I was just trying to get the 
                         fuck outta there. And after we got 
                         away, I've just been dealin' with 
                         him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well, you better start thinking about 
                         it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking 
                         about it. In fact, that's all I'm 
                         thinking about. I came this close to 
                         just driving off. Whoever set us up, 
                         knows about this place. There could've 
                         been cops sitting here waiting for 
                         me. For all we know, there's cops, 
                         driving fast, on their way here now.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Let's go in the other room...

               The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We move 
               past it, and see down a hall.

               INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

               At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door is 
               partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is obscured, 
               but Mr. White is in view.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         What the fuck am I doing here? I 
                         felt funny about this job right off. 
                         As soon as I felt it I should said 
                         "No thank you", and walked. But I 
                         never fucking listen. Every time I 
                         ever got burned buying weed, I always 
                         knew the guy wasn't right. I just 
                         felt it. But I wanted to believe 
                         him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it 
                         really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. 
                         But it's never Thai stick. And I 
                         always said if I felt that way about 
                         a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I 
                         didn't, because of fuckin' money!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's done is done, I need you cool. 
                         Are you cool?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'm cool.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Splash some water on your face. Take 
                         a breather.

               We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on 
               his face.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I'm gonna get me my smokes.

               Mr. White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and 
               OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us, 
               bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries his 
               face. Mr. White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in 
               his hand.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Want a smoke?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why not?

               The two men light up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Okay, let's go through what happened. 
                         We're in the place, everything's 
                         going fine. Then the alarm gets 
                         tripped. I turn around and all these 
                         cops are outside. You're right, it 
                         was like, bam! I blink my eyes are 
                         they're there. Everybody starts going 
                         apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts 
                         shootin' all the -

                                     MR. PINK
                         That's not correct.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's wrong with it?

                                     MR. PINK
                         The cops didn't show up after the 
                         alarm went off. They didn't show 
                         till after Mr. Blonde started shooting 
                         everyone.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw 
                         the cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. 
                         They didn't let their presence be 
                         known until after Mr. Blonde went 
                         off. I'm not sayin' they weren't 
                         there, I'm sayin' they were there. 
                         But they didn't move in till Mr. 
                         Blonde became a madman. That's how I 
                         know we were set up. You can see 
                         that, can't you, Mr. White?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -

                                     MR. PINK
                         Don't tell me your name, I don't 
                         want to know! I sure as hell ain't 
                         gonna tell ya mine.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You're right, this is bad.
                              (pause)
                         How did you get out?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Shot my way out. Everybody was 
                         shooting, so I just blasted my way 
                         outta there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

               Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has a 
               canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357 
               MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he 
               just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right 
               along side of him.

               FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with 
               them.

               We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL is 
               plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's listening to 
               LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and skating backwards 
               to the beat of the song.

               Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The 
               man and woman CRASH to the ground.

               Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car 
               that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over 
               him.

               INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

               The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the car's 
               driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it 
               off, and points his magnum at the driver.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Get outta the car! Get the fuck outta 
                         the car!

               The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

               Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's 
               locked.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Open the fucking door!

               EXTREME CLOSEUP - DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

               Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

               Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

               The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

               Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at the 
               Cops.

               Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

               Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

               Cops FIRE.

               INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down 
               the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The young cop takes off running and firing after the getaway 
               car. It's no use. Mr. Pink leaves him in the dust.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Tagged a couple of cops. Did you 
                         kill anybody?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         A few cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No real people?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Uh-uh, just cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That was one of the most insane 
                         fucking things I've ever seen. Why 
                         the fuck would Joe hire somebody 
                         like that?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I 
                         gotta get out that door, and you're 
                         standing in my way, one way of the 
                         other, you're gettin' outta my way.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That's the way I look at it. A choice 
                         between doin' ten years, and takin' 
                         out some stupid motherfucker, ain't 
                         no choice at all. But I ain't no 
                         madman either. What the fuck was Joe 
                         thinkin'? You can't work with a guy 
                         like that. That motherfucker's 
                         unstable. What do you think? Do you 
                         think he panicked, or ya think he's 
                         just trigger-happy?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! 
                         We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't 
                         tag us, when he shot up the place. I 
                         came this fucking close -
                              (hold up two fingers 
                              and makes a tiny 
                              space between them)
                         to taking his ass out myself. 
                         Everybody panics. When things get 
                         tense, everybody panics. Everybody. 
                         I don't care what your name is, you 
                         can't help it. It's human nature. 
                         But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic 
                         in your head. Ya give yourself a 
                         couple a seconds of panic, then you 
                         get a grip and deal with the 
                         situation. What you don't do, is 
                         shoot up the place and kill everybody.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What you're supposed to do is act 
                         like a fuckin' professional. A 
                         psychopath is not a professional. 
                         You can't work with a psychopath, 
                         'cause ya don't know what those sick 
                         assholes are gonna do next. I mean, 
                         Jesus Christ, how old do you think 
                         that black girl was? Twenty, maybe 
                         twenty-one?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Did ya see what happened to anybody 
                         else?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car 
                         and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, 
                         I don't know what went down.

                                     MR. PINK
                         At that point it became every man 
                         for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or 
                         Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got 
                         the foggiest. Once I got out, I never 
                         looked back.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What do you think?

                                     MR. PINK
                         What do I think? I think the cops 
                         caught them, or killed 'em.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Not even a chance they punched 
                         through? You found a hole.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. 
                         But if they did get away, where the 
                         fuck are they?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You don't think it's possible, one 
                         of them got a hold of the diamonds 
                         and pulled a -

                                     MR. PINK
                         Nope.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How can you be so sure?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got the diamonds.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got 'em, all right?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where? Are they out in the car?

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, they're not in the car. No, I 
                         don't have them on me. Ya wanna go 
                         with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go 
                         right now. But first listen to what 
                         I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set 
                         up! Somebody is in league with the 
                         cops. We got a Judas in our midst. 
                         And I'm thinkin' we should have our 
                         fuckin' heads examined for waiting 
                         around here.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That was the plan, we meet here.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Then where is everybody? I say the 
                         plan became null and void once we 
                         found out we got a rat in the house. 
                         We ain't got the slightest fuckin' 
                         idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or 
                         Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or 
                         arrested. They could be sweatin' 
                         'em, down at the station house right 
                         now. Yeah they don't know the names, 
                         but they can sing about this place. 
                         I mean, that could be happening right 
                         now. As we speak, the cops could be 
                         in their cars, drivin' here this 
                         minute.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.

                                     MR. PINK
                         What?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Two jobs back, it was a four man 
                         job, we discovered one of the team 
                         was an undercover cop.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No shit?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Thank god, we discovered in time. We 
                         hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. 
                         Just walked away from it.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? 
                         Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he 
                         set this whole thing up. Maybe he 
                         set it up to set it up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a 
                         long time. I can tell ya straight 
                         up, Joe definitely didn't have 
                         anything to do with this bullshit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. 
                         I known Joe since I was a kid. But 
                         me saying Joe definitely couldn't 
                         have done it is ridiculous. I can 
                         say I definitely didn't do it, cause 
                         I know what I did or didn't do. But 
                         I can't definitely say that about 
                         anybody else, 'cause I don't 
                         definitely know. For all I know, 
                         you're the rat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For all I know, you're the rat.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Now you're using your head. For all 
                         we know, he's the rat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That kid in there is dying from a 
                         fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. 
                         So don't be calling him a rat.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's 
                         a fuckin' rat. How many times do I 
                         hafta say it before it sinks in your 
                         skull?

               The talking stops. The two men just stare at each other. Mr. 
               Pink breaks the silence.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I gotta take a squirt, where's the 
                         commode in this dungeon?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Go down the hall, turn left, up those 
                         stairs, then turn right.

               Mr. Pink exits frame, leaving Mr. White alone.

               In the background we see what looks like an office set up.

                                     VOICE
                         How's Alabama?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Alabama? I haven't seen Alabama over 
                         a year and a half.

                                     VOICE
                         I thought you two were a team.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We were for a little while. Did about 
                         four jobs together. Then decided to 
                         call it quits. You push it long enough 
                         that woman man thing gets in your 
                         way after a while.

               We now cut to see Joe behind his desk.

                                     JOE
                         What's she doin' now?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've 
                         done a couple a jobs together. Good 
                         little thief. So, explain the 
                         telegram.

                         Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' 
                         out of a diamond wholesaler's.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Can you move the ice afterwards? I 
                         don't know nobody who can move ice.

                                     JOE
                         Not a problem, got guys waitin' for 
                         it. But what happened to Marsellus 
                         Spivey? Didn't he always move your 
                         ice?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

                                     JOE
                         What for?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

                                     JOE
                         Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two 
                         minutes. It's daylight, during 
                         business hours, dealing with a crowd. 
                         But you'll have the guys to deal 
                         with the crowd.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How many employees?

                                     JOE
                         Around twenty. Security pretty lax. 
                         They almost always just deal in boxes. 
                         Rough uncut stones they get from the 
                         syndicate. On a certain day this 
                         wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment 
                         of polished stones from Israel. 
                         They're like a way station. They are 
                         gonna get picked up the next day and 
                         sent to Vermont.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         No, they're not.

               The men share a laugh.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's the cut, poppa?

                                     JOE
                         Juicy, junior, real juicy.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               BACK TO THE GARAGE

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               We follow Mr. Pink, HANDHELD, back through the rooms and 
               hallways to the garage. We follow behind him up to Mr. White, 
               who's standing over Mr. Orange.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So, I don't know about you, but me - 
                         I'm gonna split, check into a motel 
                         and lay low for a few days.

               As he gets closer he sees Mr. Orange is out. He runs over to 
               them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So, is he dead or what?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He ain't dead.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So what is it?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I think he's just passed out.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. 
                         I thought he was dead fer sure.

               Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He will be dead fer sure, if we don't 
                         get him to a hospital.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We can't take him to a hospital.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Without medical attention, this man 
                         won't live through the night. That 
                         bullet in his belly is my fault. Now 
                         while that might not mean jack shit 
                         to you, it means a helluva lot to 
                         me. And I'm not gonna just sit around 
                         and watch him die.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well, first things first, staying 
                         here's goofy. We gotta book up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         So what do you suggest, we go to a 
                         hotel? We got a guy who's shot in 
                         the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds 
                         like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, 
                         he screams in pain.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You gotta idea, spit it out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe could help him. If we can get in 
                         touch with Joe, Joe could get him to 
                         a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to 
                         come and see him.

               During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a CLOSEUP of 
               Mr. White.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Assuming we can trust Joe, how we 
                         gonna get in touch with him? He's 
                         supposed to be here, but he ain't, 
                         which is making me nervous about 
                         being here. Even if Joe is on the up 
                         and up, he's probably not gonna be 
                         that happy with us. Joe planned a 
                         robbery, but he's got a blood bath 
                         on his hands now. Dead cops, dead 
                         robbers, dead civilians... Jesus 
                         Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna 
                         have a lot of sympathy for our plight. 
                         If I was him, I'd try and put as 
                         much distance between me and this 
                         mess an humanly possible.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Before you got here, Mr. Orange was 
                         askin' me to take him to a hospital. 
                         Now I don't like turning him over to 
                         the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. 
                         He begged me to do it. I told him to 
                         hold off till Joe got here.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're 
                         on our own. Now, I don't know a 
                         goddamn body who can help him, so if 
                         you know somebody, call 'em.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I don't know anybody.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Well, I guess we drop him off at the 
                         hospital. Since he don't know nothin' 
                         about us, I say it's his decision.

               MR. WHITE'S POV:

               CLOSEUP - MR. PINK

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Well, he knows a little about me.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You didn't tell him your name, did 
                         ya?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         I told him my first name, and where 
                         I'm from.

               There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then 
               he SCREAMS:

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why!

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         I told him where I was from a few 
                         days ago. It was just a casual 
                         conversation.

                                     MR. PINK
                         And what was tellin him your name 
                         when you weren't supposed to?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         He asked.

               Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         We had just gotten away from the 
                         cops. He just got shot. It was my 
                         fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a 
                         fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. 
                         I swear to god, I thought we was 
                         gonna die right then and there. I'm 
                         tryin' to comfort him, telling him 
                         not to worry, he's gonna be okay, 
                         I'm gonna take care of him. And he 
                         asked me what my name was. I mean, 
                         the man was dyin' in my arms. What 
                         the fuck was I supposed to tell him, 
                         "Sorry, I can't give out that 
                         information, it's against the rules. 
                         I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I 
                         shoulda, but I couldn't.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh, I don't doubt is was quite 
                         beautiful -

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Don't fuckin' patronize me.

                                     MR. PINK
                         One question: Do they have a sheet 
                         on you, where you told him you're 
                         from?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Of course.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well that's that, then. I mean, I 
                         was worried about mug shot 
                         possibilities already. But now he 
                         knows: (a) what you look like, (b) 
                         what your first name is, (c) where 
                         you're from and (d) what your 
                         specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta 
                         show him a helluva lot of pictures 
                         for him to pick you out. That's it 
                         right, you didn't tell him anything 
                         else that could narrow down the 
                         selection?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         If I have to tell you again to back 
                         off, me an you are gonna go round 
                         and round.

               Mr. Pink walks out of the CLOSEUP and turns his back on Mr. 
               White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We ain't taking him to a hospital.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         If we don't, he'll die.

                                     MR. PINK
                         And I'm very sad about that. But 
                         some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         That fuckin did it!

               Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

               Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the 
               mouth.

               END OF POV

               Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic 
               fight. They go at each other like a couple of alley cats.

               As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You little motherfucker!

               Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

                                     MR. PINK
                         Ya wanna fuck with me?! I'll show 
                         you who you're fuckin with!

               The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. Mr. 
               White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

               Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it 
               out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, 
               and goes for his own weapon.

               The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their 
               guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You wanna shoot me, you little piece 
                         of shit? Take a shot!

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck you, White! I didn't create 
                         this situation, I'm just dealin' 
                         with it. You're acting like a first-
                         year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a 
                         professional. They get him, they can 
                         get you, they get you, they get closer 
                         to me, and that can't happen. And 
                         you, you motherfucker, are looking 
                         at me like it's my fault. I didn't 
                         tell him my name. I didn't tell him 
                         where I was from. I didn't tell him 
                         what I knew better than to tell him. 
                         Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost 
                         told me your name. You, buddy, are 
                         stuck in a situation you created. So 
                         if you wanna throw bad looks 
                         somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

               Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So if you wanna shoot somebody, put 
                         that gun in your mouth and shoot 
                         yourself.

               Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         You kids don't play so rough. 
                         Somebody's gonna start crying.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM CLOSEUP ON MR. BLONDE

               The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

               Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and 
               eating a hot dog.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought you 
                         might've gotten caught. What happened?

               Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and 
               starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out.

               He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just 
               eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

               This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr. Pink 
               tries to talk through it.

               We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Really, how did you get away?

               Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You saw what happened to me, I found 
                         a hole and booked.

               Silence.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Where's Mr. Blue?

               Blonde looks in the bathroom.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were hopin' you two would be 
                         together.

               Blonde looks out the window.

                                     MR. PINK
                         That was the big question we had, 
                         what happened to Mr. Blue and you?

               Blonde walks away from the window.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were worried the cops got ya.

               Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He got it in the belly. He's still 
                         alive, but won't be for long.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Enough! You better start talkin' to 
                         us, asshole, cause we got shit we 
                         need to talk about. We're already 
                         freaked out, we need you actin freaky 
                         like we need a fuckin' bag on our 
                         hip.

               Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves 
               towards them.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         So, talk.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We think we got a rat in the house.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What would ever make you think that?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Is that supposed to be funny?

                                     MR. PINK
                         We don't think this place is safe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         This place just ain't secure anymore. 
                         We're leaving, and you should go 
                         with us.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Nobody's going anywhere.

               Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.

               After a few beats the silence is broken.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Piss on this turd, we're outta here.

               Mr. White turns to leave.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Don't take another step, Mr. White.

               Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. 
               Blonde.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Fuck you, maniac! It's your fuckin' 
                         fault we're in so much trouble.

               Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              White)
                         What's this guy's problem?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta 
                         problem. I gotta big problem with 
                         any trigger-happy madman who almost 
                         gets me shot!

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What're you talkin' about?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That fuckin' shooting spree in the 
                         store.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, 
                         they deserve what they got.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You almost killed me, asshole! If I 
                         had any idea what type of guy you 
                         were, I never would've agreed to 
                         work with you.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         You gonna bark all day, little doggie, 
                         or are you gonna bite?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't 
                         catch it. Would you repeat it?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (slowly)
                         I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, 
                         dog, or are you gonna bite."

                                     MR. PINK
                         Both of you two assholes knock it 
                         the fuck off and calm down!

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Blonde)
                         So you wanna git bit, huh?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a 
                         fuckin' playground!
                              (pause)
                         I don't believe this shit, both of 
                         you got ten years on me, and I'm the 
                         only one actin like a professional. 
                         You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' 
                         niggers. You ever work a job with a 
                         bunch of niggers? They're just like 
                         you two, always fightin', always 
                         sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You said yourself, you thought about 
                         takin' him out.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Then. That time has passed. Right 
                         now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I 
                         completely trust. He's too fuckin' 
                         homicidal to be workin' with the 
                         cops.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You takin' his side?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck sides! What we need is a little 
                         solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' 
                         a red hot poker up our asses and we 
                         gotta find out whose hand's on the 
                         handle. Now I know I'm no piece of 
                         shit...
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              White)
                         And I'm pretty sure you're a good 
                         boy...
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Blonde)
                         And I'm fuckin positive you're on 
                         the level. So let's figure out who's 
                         the bad guy.

               Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

               Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning, 
               talking about Madonna.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Well, that was sure exciting.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't 
                         you? Me too. I don't know about the 
                         rest of you fellas, but my heart's 
                         beatin' fast.
                              (pause for a beat)
                         Okay you guys, follow me.

               Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

               The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Follow you where?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Down to my car.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Why?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         It's a surprise.

               Mr. Blonde walks out.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking towards 
               the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind. 
               The Camera is HANDHELD following behind them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We still gotta get out of here.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         We're gonna sit here and wait.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For what, the cops?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Nice Guy Eddie.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think 
                         Nice Guy's anywhere but on a plane 
                         half way to Costa Rica?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Cause I just talked to him. He's on 
                         his way down here, and nobody's going 
                         anywhere till be gets here.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why 
                         the fuck didn't you say that in the 
                         first place?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         You didn't ask.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look 
                         at the little surprise I brought 
                         you.

               Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed, 
               uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Since we got to wait for Nice Guy 
                         Eddie anyway, let's talk to our boy 
                         in blue here and see if he knows 
                         anything about this rat business.

               The three crooks share a frightening laugh. We slowly ZOOM 
               INTO a CLOSEUP of the cop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD:

                                       "MR. BLONDE"

               INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

               We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone, 
               sitting behind his desk.

                                     JOE
                              (into phone)
                         Sid, I'm tellin' you don't worry 
                         about it. You had a bad couple of 
                         months, it happens.
                              (pause)
                         Sid, Sid, Sid... Stop, you're 
                         embarrassing me. I don't need to be 
                         told what I already know. When you 
                         have bad months, you do what every 
                         business man in the worlds does, I 
                         don't care if he's Donald Trump or 
                         Irving the tailor. Ya ride it out.

               There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

                                     JOE
                         Come in.

               One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps inside. 
               Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks towards 
               the man.

                                     TEDDY
                         Vic Vega's outside.

                                     JOE
                         Tell him to come in.

               Teddy leaves.

                                     JOE
                              (into phone)
                         Sid, a friend of mine's here. I gotta 
                         go.
                              (pause)
                         Good enough, bye.

               He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front 
               of the desk.

               Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks 
               in.

               Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr. Blonde. 
               Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket.

               Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

               The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the 
               door behind him.

                                     JOE
                         How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' 
                         good, ain't it?

                                     VIC
                         It's a change.

                                     JOE
                         Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?

                                     VIC
                         Sure.

                                     JOE
                         Take a seat.

               Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair set 
               in front of Joe's desk.

                                     JOE
                              (while he pours the 
                              drink)
                         Who's your parole officer?

                                     VIC
                         A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour 
                         Scagnetti.

                                     JOE
                         How is he?

                                     VIC
                         Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave 
                         the halfway house.

                                     JOE
                         Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' 
                         jungle bunny goes out there, slits 
                         some old woman's throat for twenty-
                         five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris 
                         Day as a parole officer. But a good 
                         fella like you gets stuck with a 
                         ball-bustin' prick.

               Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic 
               swallows some Remy.

                                     VIC
                         I just want you to know, Joe, how 
                         much I appreciate your care packages 
                         on the inside.

                                     JOE
                         What the hell did you expect me to 
                         do? Just forget about you?

                                     VIC
                         I just wanted you to know, they meant 
                         a lot.

                                     JOE
                         It's the least I could do Vic. I 
                         wish I coulda done more.
                              (Joe flashes a side 
                              grin at Vic)
                         Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? 
                         What're your plans?

                                     VIC
                         Well, what I wanna do is go back to 
                         work. But I got this Scagnetti prick 
                         deep up my ass. He won't let me leave 
                         the halfway house till I get some 
                         piece of shit job. My plans have 
                         always been to be part of the team 
                         again.

               There's a KNOCK at the door.

                                     JOE
                         Come in.

               The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic 
               turns around in his seat and sees him.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Vic)
                         I see ya sittin here, but I don't 
                         believe it.

               Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

                                     EDDIE
                         How ya doin', Toothpick?

                                     VIC
                         Fine, now.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you 
                         up personally at the pen. This whole 
                         week's just been crazy. I've had my 
                         head up my ass the entire time.

                                     VIC
                         Funny you should mention it. That's 
                         what your father and I been talkin' 
                         about.

                                     EDDIE
                         That I should've picked you up?

                                     VIC
                         No. That your head's been up your 
                         ass. I walk through the door and Joe 
                         says "Vic, you're back, thank god. 
                         Finally somebody who knows what the 
                         fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, 
                         my son, is a fuck up." And I say 
                         "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." 
                         "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My 
                         son, I love him, but he's taking my 
                         business and flushing it down the 
                         fuckin' toilet! "
                              (to Joe)
                         I'm not tellin' tales out of school. 
                         You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

                                     JOE
                         Eddie, I hate like hell for you to 
                         hear it this way. But when Vic asked 
                         me how's business, well, you don't 
                         lie to a man who's just done four 
                         years in the slammer for ya.

               Eddie bobs his head up and down.

                                     EDDIE
                         Oh really, is that a fact?

               Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

               The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle 
               on the floor of Joe's office.

               Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

                                     JOE
                              (yelling)
                         Okay, okay, enough, enough! Playtime's 
                         over! You wanna roll around on the 
                         floor, do it in Eddie's office, not 
                         mine!

               The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled, 
               hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves together, 
               they continue to taunt one another.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, did ya see that?

                                     JOE
                         What?

                                     EDDIE
                         Guy got me on the ground, tried to 
                         fuck me.

                                     VIC
                         You fuckin' wish.

                                     EDDIE
                         You tried to fuck me in my father's 
                         office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, 
                         whatever you wanna do in the privacy 
                         of your own home, go do it. But don't 
                         try to fuck me. I don't think of you 
                         that way. I mean, I like you a lot -

                                     VIC
                         Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't 
                         throw you to the crew.

                                     EDDIE
                         No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four 
                         years fuckin' punks in the ass made 
                         you appreciate prime rib when you 
                         get it.

                                     VIC
                         I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd 
                         make you my dog's bitch. You'd be 
                         suckin' the dick and going down on a 
                         mangy T-bone hound.

                                     EDDIE
                         Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, 
                         walks into jail a white man, walks 
                         out talkin' like a nigger. It's all 
                         that black semen been shootin' up 
                         his butt. It's backed up into his 
                         brain and comes out of his mouth.

                                     JOE
                         Are you two finished? We were talkin' 
                         about some serious shit when you 
                         came in Eddie. We got a big problem 
                         we're tryin' to solve. Now Eddie, 
                         would you like to sit down and help 
                         us solve it, or do you two wanna 
                         piss fart around?

               Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both 
               take seats in front of Joe's desk.

                                     JOE
                         Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a 
                         parole problem.

                                     EDDIE
                         Really? Who's your P.O.?

                                     VIC
                         Seymour Scagnetti.

                                     EDDIE
                         Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a 
                         motherfucker.

                                     VIC
                         He is a motherfucker. He won't let 
                         me leave the halfway house till I 
                         get some piece of shit job.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're coming back to work for us, 
                         right?

                                     VIC
                         I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole 
                         I got an honest-to-goodness job before 
                         he'll let me move out on my own. I 
                         can't work for you guys and be worried 
                         about gettin' back before ten o'clock 
                         curfew.

                                     JOE
                              (to Eddie)
                         We can work this out, can't we?

                                     EDDIE
                         This isn't all that bad. We can give 
                         you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put 
                         you on the rotation at Long Beach as 
                         a dock worker.

                                     VIC
                         I don't wanna lift crates.

                                     EDDIE
                         You don't hafta lift shit. You don't 
                         really work there. But as far as the 
                         records are concerned, you do. I 
                         call up Matthews, the foreman, tell 
                         him he's got a new guy. You're on 
                         the schedule. You got a timecard, 
                         it's clocked in and out for you 
                         everyday, and you get a pay check at 
                         the end of the week. And ya know 
                         dock workers don't do too bad. So 
                         you can move into a halfway decent 
                         place without Scagnetti thinkin "what 
                         the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever 
                         wants to make a surprise visit, you're 
                         gone that day. That day we sent you 
                         to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit 
                         you needed to unload there. You're 
                         at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a 
                         bunch of shit and bringing it back. 
                         Part of your job is goin' different 
                         places - and we got places all over 
                         the place.

                                     JOE
                              (to Vic)
                         Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
                              (to Eddie)
                         Vic was worried.

                                     EDDIE
                         Me and you'll drive down to Long 
                         Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you 
                         to Matthews, tell him what's going 
                         on.

                                     VIC
                         That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
                              (pause)
                         When do you think you'll need me for 
                         real work?

                                     JOE
                         Well, it's kinda a strange time right 
                         now. Things are kinda -

                                     EDDIE
                         Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas 
                         coming up. And we're kinda just gettin 
                         ready for that right now.

                                     JOE
                         Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. 
                         Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti 
                         fuck off your back, and we'll be 
                         talking to ya.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear 
                         it out. I know you don't like to use 
                         any of the boys on these jobs, but 
                         technically, Vic ain't one of the 
                         boys. He's been gone for four years. 
                         He ain't on no one's list. Ya know 
                         he can handle himself, ya know you 
                         can trust him.

               Joe looks at Vic.

               Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

                                     JOE
                         How would you feel about pullin' a 
                         heist with about five other guys?

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his 
               portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are coming 
               out of his car radio in the form of "LOVE GOES WHERE MY 
               ROSEMARY GOES" by Edison Lighthouse.

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         Hey Dov, we got a major situation 
                         here.
                              (pause)
                         I know you know that. I gotta talk 
                         with daddy and find out what he wants 
                         done.

               FLASH ON

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed 
               behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde surround 
               him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. "LOVE GROWS..." 
               PLAYS over the soundtrack.

               BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         All I know is what Vic told me. He 
                         said the place turned into a fuckin' 
                         bullet festival. He took a cop as 
                         hostage, just to get the fuck out of 
                         there.

               FLASH ON

               WAREHOUSE

               The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.

               BACK TO EDDIE

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         Do I sound like I'm jokin'? He's 
                         fuckin' driving around with the cop 
                         in his trunk.
                              (pause)
                         I don't know who did that. I don't 
                         know who has the loot, if anybody 
                         has the loot. Who's dead, who's alive, 
                         who's caught, who's not... I will 
                         know, I'm practically there. But 
                         what do I tell these guys about daddy?
                              (pause)
                         You sure that's what he said?
                              (pause)
                         Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside 
               the warehouse.

               Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of the 
               car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to himself)
                         Fucking assholes.

               Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open, and 
               steps inside the warehouse.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still WAILING 
               on him.

               Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

                                     EDDIE
                         What in Sam Hill is goin' on?

               Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

                         MR. PINK
                 Hey, Nice Guy, we got 
                 a -

                                                       MR WHITE
                                               You askin' what's goin' 
                                               on? Where the fuck is Joe?

               Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

                                     EDDIE
                         Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on 
                         us if we don't get him taken care 
                         of.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were set up, the cops were waiting 
                         for us.

                                     EDDIE
                         What? Nobody set anybody up.

                                     MR. PINK
                         The cops were there waitin' for us!

                                     EDDIE
                         Bullshit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, 
                         we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the 
                         cops had that store staked out.

                                     EDDIE
                         Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

                                     MR. PINK
                         What the fuck d'you think we've been 
                         askin' each other?

                                     EDDIE
                         And what are your answers? Was it 
                         me? You think I set you up?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't know, but somebody did.

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody did. You assholes turn the 
                         jewelry store into a wild west show, 
                         and you wonder why cops show up.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Where's Joseph?

                                     EDDIE
                         I ain't talked to him. I talked to 
                         Dov. Dov said he's comin' out here, 
                         and he's fucking pissed.

                                     MR. PINK
                              (to Mr. White)
                         I told ya he'd be pissed.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         What are you gonna do about him?

                                     EDDIE
                         Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance 
                         to breathe. I got a few questions of 
                         my own, ya know.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You ain't dying, he is.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll call somebody.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who?

                                     EDDIE
                         A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you 
                         think. I'll call a doctor, take care 
                         of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's 
                         Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Brown's dead, we don't know about 
                         Blue.

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Well, he's either dead or he's alive 
                         or the cops got him or they don't.

               DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

                                     EDDIE (O.S.)
                         I take it this is the bastard you 
                         told me about.
                              (referring to the cop)
                         Why the hell are you beating on him?

                                     MR. PINK
                         So he'll tell us who the fuck set us 
                         up.

                                     EDDIE
                         Would you stop it with that shit! 
                         You beat on this prick enough, he'll 
                         tell ya he started the Chicago fire. 
                         That don't necessarily make it so. 
                         Okay, first things fucking last, 
                         where's the shit? Please tell me 
                         somebody brought something with them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got a bag. I stashed it till I 
                         could be sure this place wasn't a 
                         police station.

                                     EDDIE
                         Well, let's go get it. We also gotta 
                         get rid of all those cars. It looks 
                         like Sam's hot car lot outside.
                              (pointing to Mr. Blonde)
                         You stay here and babysit Orange and 
                         the cop.
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Pink and Mr. White)
                         You two take a car each, I'll follow 
                         ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, 
                         then we'll pick up the stones. And 
                         while I'm following you, I'll arrange 
                         for some sort of a doctor for our 
                         friend.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We can't leave these guys with him.

               Meaning Mr. Blonde.

                                     EDDIE
                         Why not?

               Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Because this guy's a fucking psycho. 
                         And if you think Joe's pissed at us, 
                         that ain't nothing compared to how 
                         pissed off I am at him, for puttin' 
                         me in the same room as this bastard.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (to Eddie)
                         You see what I been puttin' up with? 
                         As soon as I walk through the door 
                         I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm 
                         what you told me about us stayin' 
                         put and Mr. White whips out his gun, 
                         sticks it in my face, and starts 
                         screaming "You motherfucker, I'm 
                         gonna blow you away, blah, blah, 
                         blah."

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He's the reason the place turned 
                         into a shooting gallery.
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         What are you, a silent partner? 
                         Fuckin' tell him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He seems all right now, but he went 
                         crazy in the store.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         This is what he was doin'.

               Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the store.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         I told 'em not to touch the alarm. 
                         They touched it. I blew 'em full of 
                         holes. If they hadn't done what I 
                         told 'em not it, they'd still be 
                         alive.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That's your excuse for going on a 
                         kill crazy rampage?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         I don't like alarms.

                                     EDDIE
                         What does it matter who stays with 
                         the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. 
                         Not after he's seen everybody. You 
                         should've never took him outta your 
                         trunk in the first place.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were trying to find out what he 
                         knew about the set up.

                                     EDDIE
                         There is no fuckin' set up!
                              (Eddie takes charge)
                         Look, this is the news. Blondie, you 
                         stay here and take care of them two. 
                         White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if 
                         Joe gets here and sees all those 
                         fucking cars parked out front, he's 
                         going to be as mad at me as he is at 
                         you.

               Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse 
               talking amongst themselves.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

               Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly turns 
               his head towards the cop.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Alone at last.

               CLOSEUP - COP'S FACE

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Now where were we?

                                     COP
                         I told you I don't know anything 
                         about any fucking set up. I've only 
                         been on the force eight months, nobody 
                         tells me anything! I don't know 
                         anything! You can torture me if you 
                         want -

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Thanks, don't mind if I do.

                                     COP
                         Your boss even said there wasn't a 
                         set up.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         First off, I don't have a boss. Are 
                         you clear about that?

               He SLAPS the cop's face.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         I asked you a question. Are you clear 
                         about that?

                                     COP
                         Yes.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I 
                         don't really care about what you 
                         know or don't know. I'm gonna torture 
                         you for awhile regardless. Not to 
                         get information, but because torturing 
                         a cop amuses me. There's nothing you 
                         can say, I've heard it all before. 
                         There's nothing you can do. Except 
                         pray for a quick death, which you 
                         ain't gonna get.

               He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.

               COP'S POV

               Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S "super 
                         sounds of the seventies" weekend.

               He turns on the radio.

               Stealer's Wheel's hit "STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU" PLAYS 
               over the speaker.

               NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

               Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. He opens a razor.

               Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, holding 
               the razor, singing along with the song.

               Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

               A SLASH across the face.

               The cop / camera moves around wildly.

               Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, singing 
               along with the seventies hit.

               Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's / our ear.

               The cop / camera moves around wildly.

               Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop / us to see.

               INT. / EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

               We follow Mr. Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse... to 
               his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of 
               gasoline.

               He walks back inside the warehouse...

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               ...carrying the can of gas.

               Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING 
               him not to do this.

               Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

               Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         "Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to 
                         the right. Here I am, stuck in the 
                         middle with you."

               He moves the match up to the cop...

               ...when a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

               The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the bloody 
               Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

               We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET HITS 
               and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

               Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

               Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody trail 
               behind him.

               When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (feebly)
                         What's your name?

                                     COP
                         Marvin.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Marvin what?

                                     COP
                         Marvin Nash.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Listen to me, Marvin Nash. I'm a 
                         cop.

                                     MARVIN
                         I know.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (surprised)
                         You do?

                                     MARVIN
                         Your name's Freddy something.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Freddy Newendyke.

                                     MARVIN
                         Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, 
                         about five months ago.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Shit. I don't remember that at all.

                                     MARVIN
                         I do.
                              (pause)
                         How do I look?

               The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and 
               the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I don't know what to tell you Marvin.

               Marvin starts to weep.

                                     MARVIN
                         That fucking bastard! That fucking 
                         sick fucking bastard!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's 
                         officers positioned and waiting to 
                         move in a block away.

                                     MARVIN
                              (screaming)
                         What the fuck are they waiting for? 
                         That motherfucker cut off my ear! He 
                         slashed my face! I'm deformed!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         And I'm dying. They don't know that. 
                         All they know is they're not to make 
                         a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I 
                         was sent undercover to get Cabot. 
                         You heard 'em, they said he's on his 
                         way. Don't pussy out on me now, 
                         Marvin. We're just gonna sit here 
                         and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his 
                         fuckin' head through that door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD:

                                       "MR. ORANGE"

               INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a Malcom 
               X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star on it, and 
               a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny bacon, cheese and 
               avocado burger. He sits in a booth all alone. He's waiting 
               for somebody. As he waits, he practically empties an entire 
               bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not by mistake either - 
               that's just how he likes it.

               We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing a 
               high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot 
               Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop towards 
               him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered across his face.

               CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway. 
               We hear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                                     FREDDY (O.S.)
                         Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's 
                         inside. Cabot's doing a job and take 
                         a big fat guess who he wants on the 
                         team?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         This better not be some Freddy joke.

               LOW ANGLE looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

                                     FREDDY
                         It ain't no joke, I'm in there. I'm 
                         up his ass.

               CLOSEUP - HOLDAWAY

               Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Congratulations.

               EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide 
               into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot of 
               talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.

               INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

               We are frozen on a MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Holdaway listening to 
               Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                                     FREDDY (O.S.)
                         Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to 
                         meet me. He says I should just hang 
                         around my apartment and wait for a 
                         phone call. Well after waiting three 
                         goddamn days by the fuckin' phone, 
                         he calls me last night and says Joe's 
                         ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen 
                         minutes.

               The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed 
               and says:

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Who all picked you up?

               From here to end we cut back and forth.

                                     FREDDY
                         Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         ...What bar?

                                     FREDDY
                         The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When 
                         we got there, I met Joe and a guy 
                         named Mr. White. It's a phony name. 
                         My name's Mr. Orange.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         You ever seen this motherfucker 
                         before?

                                     FREDDY
                         Who, Mr. White?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Yeah.

                                     FREDDY
                         No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one 
                         of Cabot's soldiers either. He's 
                         gotta be from outta town. But Joe 
                         knows him real well.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         How can you tell?

                                     FREDDY
                         The way they talk to each other. You 
                         can tell they're buddies.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Did the two of you talk?

                                     FREDDY
                         Me and Mr. White?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Yeah.

                                     FREDDY
                         A little.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         What about?

                                     FREDDY
                         The Brewers.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         The Milwaukee Brewers?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yeah. They had just won the night 
                         before, and he made a killing off 
                         'em.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, 
                         his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. 
                         And I'll bet you everything from a 
                         diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-
                         know, that in Milwaukee they got a 
                         sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's 
                         ass. I want you to go through the 
                         mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with 
                         a history of armed robbery, and put 
                         a name to that face.

               Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                              (with his mouth full)
                         What kinds questions did Cabot ask?

                                     FREDDY
                         Where I was from, who I knew, how I 
                         knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit 
                         like that.

               Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He 
               motions for Freddy to elaborate.

                                     FREDDY
                         He asked me if I ever done armed 
                         robbery before. I read him my credits. 
                         I robbed a few gas and sips, sold 
                         some weed, told him recently I held 
                         the shotgun while me and another guy 
                         pulled down a poker game in Portland.

               CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CLOSEUP.

                                     HOLDAWAY(O.S.)
                         Didja use the commode story?

                                     FREDDY
                         Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous. Holdaway 
               wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy sits on one 
               of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket, looking at 
               pieces of paper stapled together.

                                     FREDDY
                         What's this?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's a scene. Memorize it.

                                     FREDDY
                         What?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         A undercover cop has got to be Marlon 
                         Brando. To do this job you got to be 
                         a great actor. You got to be 
                         naturalistic. You got to be 
                         naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a 
                         great actor you're a bad actor, and 
                         bad acting is bullshit in this job.

                                     FREDDY
                              (referring to the 
                              papers)
                         But what is this?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's a amusing anecdote about a drug 
                         deal.

                                     FREDDY
                         What?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Something funny that happened to you 
                         while you were doing a job.

                                     FREDDY
                         I gotta memorize all this shit?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's like a joke. You remember what's 
                         important, and the rest you make 
                         your own. The only way to make it 
                         your own is to keep sayin' it, and 
                         sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' 
                         it, and sayin' it.

                                     FREDDY
                         I can do that.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         The things you gotta remember are 
                         the details. It's the details that 
                         sell your story. Now this story takes 
                         place in this men's room. So you 
                         gotta know the details about this 
                         men's room. You gotta know they got 
                         a blower instead of a towel to dry 
                         your hands. You gotta know the stalls 
                         ain't got no doors. You gotta know 
                         whether they got liquid or powdered 
                         soap, whether they got hot water or 
                         not, 'cause if you do your job when 
                         you tell your story, everybody should 
                         believe it. And if you tell your 
                         story to somebody who's actually 
                         taken a piss in this men's room, and 
                         you get one detail they remember 
                         right, they'll swear by you.

               INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing 
               the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still 
               reading it from the page, and every once in a while he 
               stumbles over his words.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...this was during the Los Angeles 
                         marijuana drought of '86. I still 
                         had a connection. Which was insane, 
                         'cause you couldn't get weed any 
                         fuckin' where then. Anyway, I had a 
                         connection with this hippie chick up 
                         in Santa Cruz. All and my friends 
                         knew it. And they'd give me a call 
                         and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin' 
                         some, you think you could buy me 
                         some too?" They knew I smoked, so 
                         they'd ask me to buy a little for 
                         them when I was buyin'. But it got 
                         to be every time I bought some weed, 
                         I was buyin' for four or five 
                         different people. Finally I said, 
                         "Fuck this shit." I'm makin' this 
                         bitch rich. She didn't have to do 
                         jack shit, she never even had to 
                         meet these people. I was fuckin' 
                         doin' all the work. So I got together 
                         with her and told her, "Hey, I'm 
                         sick of this shit. I'm comin' through 
                         for everybody, and nobody's comin' 
                         through for me. So, either I'm gonna 
                         tell all my friends to find their 
                         own source, or you give me a bunch 
                         of weed, I'll sell it to them, give 
                         you the money, minus ten percent, 
                         and I get my pot for free." So, I 
                         did if for awhile...

               FREDDY EXITS FRAME

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy enters 
               frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, 
               finishing his sentence. When we move to a wider shot we see 
               Freddy performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking 
               lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car. Freddy 
               paces back and forth as he performs his story.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...but then that got to be a pain in 
                         the ass. People called me on the 
                         phone all the fuckin' time. I couldn't 
                         rent a fuckin' tape without six phone 
                         calls interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy, 
                         when's the next time you're gettin' 
                         some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin' to 
                         watch 'Lost Boys' - when I have some, 
                         I'll let you know." And then these 
                         rinky-dink pot heads come by - there's 
                         my friends and everything, but still. 
                         I got all my shit laid out in sixty 
                         dollar bags. Well, they don't want 
                         sixty dollars worth. They want ten 
                         dollars worth. Breaking it up is a 
                         major fuckin' pain in the ass. I 
                         don't even know how much ten dollars 
                         worth is. "Well, fuck, man, I don't 
                         want that much around. If I have 
                         that much around I'll smoke it." 
                         "Hey, if you guys can't control your 
                         smokin, that's not my problem. You 
                         motherfuckers been smokin' for five 
                         years, be a adult about it." Finally 
                         I just told my connection, count me 
                         out. But as it turns out, I'm the 
                         best guy she had, and she depended a 
                         lot on my business. But I was still 
                         sick to death of it. And she's trying 
                         to talk me into not quitin'. Now 
                         this was a very weird situation, 
                         'cause I don't know if you remember 
                         back in '86, there was a major fuckin' 
                         drought. Nobody and anything. People 
                         were livin' on resin and smokin' the 
                         wood in their pipes for months. And 
                         this chick had a bunch, and was 
                         beggin' me to sell it. So I told her 
                         I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man 
                         anymore. But I would take a little 
                         bit and sell it to my close, close, 
                         close friends. She agreed to that, 
                         and said we'd keep the same 
                         arrangement as before, ten percent 
                         and free pot for me, as long as I 
                         helped her out that weekend. She had 
                         a brick of weed she was sellin', and 
                         she didn't want to go to the buy 
                         alone...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

               Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a 
               table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his story. 
               The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...Her brother usually goes with 
                         her, but he's in county unexpectedly.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What for?

                                     FREDDY
                         Traffic tickets gone to warrant. 
                         They stopped him for something, found 
                         the warrants on 'im, took 'im to 
                         jail. She doesn't want to walk around 
                         alone with all that weed. Well, I 
                         don't wanna do this, I have a bad 
                         feeling about it, but she keeps askin' 
                         me, keeps askin' me, finally I said 
                         okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to 
                         it. Well, we're picking this guy up 
                         at the train station.

                                     JOE
                         You're picking the buyer up at the 
                         train station? You're carrying the 
                         weed on you?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yeah, the guy needed it right away. 
                         Don't ask me why. So we get to the 
                         train station, and we're waitin' for 
                         the guy. Now I'm carrying the weed 
                         in one of those carry-on bags, and I 
                         gotta take a piss. So I tell the 
                         connection I'll be right back, I'm 
                         goin' to the little boys room...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

               MEDIUM ON FREDDY

               He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his 
               shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We move 
               into a CLOSEUP.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         ...So I walk into the men's room, 
                         and who's standing there?

               FREEZE FRAME on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles 
               County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes 
               are on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         ...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs 
                         and a German Shepherd.

                         They were waiting for you?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         No. They were just a bunch of cops 
                         hangin' out in the men's room, 
                         talkin'. When I walked through the 
                         door they all stopped what they were 
                         talking about and looked at me.

                         That's hard, man. That's a fuckin' 
                         hard situation.

               BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

               EXTREME CLOSEUP ON GERMAN SHEPHERD

               Barking his head off.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         The German Shepherd starts barkin'. 
                         He's barkin' at me. I mean it's 
                         obvious he's barkin' at me.

               We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can 
               hear the dog barking.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Every nerve ending, all of my senses, 
                         the blood in my veins, everything I 
                         has was screaming, "Take off, man, 
                         just take off, get the fuck outta 
                         there! "Panic hit me like a bucket 
                         of water. First there was the shock 
                         of it - BAM, right in the face! Then 
                         I'm just standin' there drenched in 
                         panic. And all those sheriffs are 
                         lookin' at me and they know. They 
                         can smell it. As sure as that fuckin' 
                         dog can, they can smell it on me.

               FREEZE FRAME

               Freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in front of the sheriffs. 
               It suddenly jerks to life, and moves to speed. The dog is 
               barking. Freddy moves to his right, out of frame. We stay on 
               the sheriffs. One sheriff yells at the dog.

                                     SHERIFF #1
                         Shut up!

               The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story. A 
               couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but 
               as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

                                     SHERIFF #2
                         So my gun's drawn, right? I got it 
                         aimed right at him. I tell 'em, 
                         "Freeze, don't fuckin' move." And 
                         the little idiot's lookin' at me, 
                         nodding his head "Yes," sayin' "I 
                         know... I know... I know." Meanwhile 
                         his right hand is creepin' towards 
                         his glove box. So I scream at him, 
                         "Asshole, you better fuckin' freeze 
                         right now! " And he's still lookin' 
                         right at me, saying "I know... I 
                         know... I know." And his right hand's 
                         still going for the glove box.

               THE CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against 
               the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

                                     SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
                         I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna shoot 
                         you in the face right now if you 
                         don't put your hands on the fuckin' 
                         dash." And the guy's girlfriend, a 
                         real sexy Oriental bitch, starts 
                         screamin' at him, "Chuck, are you 
                         out of your mind? Put your hands on 
                         the dash like the officer said." And 
                         then like nothing, the guy snaps out 
                         of it and casually puts his hands on 
                         the dash.

               Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the 
               sheriffs over to the sink.

               THE CAMERA PANS with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink. He 
               looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands.

                                     SHERIFF #1
                         What was he goin' for?

                                     SHERIFF #2
                         His registration. Stupid fuckin' 
                         citizen, doesn't have the slightest 
                         idea how close he came to gettin' 
                         shot.

               Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but 
               there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on the 
               drying machine. He can't hear anything the sheriffs say now. 
               The sound of the machine dominates the sound track.

               These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

               We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone. 
               Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

               The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment 
               getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket and slips 
               on some sneakers.

               DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand comes 
               into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE UP to his 
               face.

               Fear.

               watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up to 
               Eddie's parked car.

                                     COP #1 (O.S.)

               Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

               Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.

               INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the 
               passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat 
               together.

                                     MR. PINK
                         ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, 
                         black women ain't the same as white 
                         women.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (sarcastically)
                         There's a slight difference.

               The car laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Go ahead and laugh, you know what I 
                         mean. What a while bitch will put up 
                         with, a black bitch won't put up 
                         with for a minute. They got a line, 
                         and if you cross it, they fuck you 
                         up.

                         I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on 
                         this. I've seen it happen.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a 
                         truism, how come every nigger I know 
                         treats his woman like a piece of 
                         shit?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'll make you a bet that those same 
                         damn niggers who were showin' their 
                         ass in public, when their bitches 
                         get 'em home, they chill the fuck 
                         out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Not these guys.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, those guys too.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let me tell you guys a story. In one 
                         of daddy's clubs there was this black 
                         cocktail waitress named Elois.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Elois?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called 
                         her Lady E.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where was she from, Compton?

                                     EDDIE
                         No. She was from Ladora Heights.

                                     MR. PINK
                         The black Beverly Hills. I knew this 
                         lady from Ladora Heights once.
                              (in a stuck up black 
                              female voice)
                         "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's 
                         the black Beverly Hills."

                                     EDDIE
                         It's not the black Beverly Hills, 
                         it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, 
                         this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-
                         upper. I bet every guy who's ever 
                         met her has jacked off to her at 
                         least once. You know who she looked 
                         like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV 
                         show "Get Christie Love"? She was a 
                         black female cop. She always used to 
                         say "You're under arrest, sugar."

                                     MR. PINK
                         I was in the sixth grade when that 
                         show was on. I totally dug it. What 
                         the fuck was the name of the chick 
                         who played Christie Love?

                                     EDDIE
                         Pam Grier.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier 
                         was the other one. Pam Grier made 
                         the movies. Christie Love was like a 
                         Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.

                                     MR. PINK
                         What the fuck was that chick's name? 
                         Oh this is just great, I'm totally 
                         fuckin' tortured now.

                                     EDDIE
                         Well, whoever she was, Elois looked 
                         like her. So one night I walk into 
                         the club, and no Elois. Now the 
                         bartender was a wetback, he was a 
                         friend of mine, his name was Carlos. 
                         So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's 
                         Lady E tonight?" Well apparently 
                         Lady E was married to this real piece 
                         of dog shit. I mean a real animal. 
                         And apparently he would so things to 
                         her.

                                     FREDDY
                         Do things? What would he do? You 
                         mean like beat her up?

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody knows for sure what he did. 
                         We just know he did something. Anyway, 
                         Elois plays it real cool. And waits 
                         for the next time this bag of shit 
                         gets drunk. So one night the guy 
                         gets drunk and passes out on the 
                         couch. So while the guy's inebriated, 
                         she strips him naked. Then she takes 
                         some crazy glue and glues his dick 
                         to his belly.

               The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm dead fuckin' serious. She put 
                         some on his dick and some on his 
                         belly, then stuck 'em together. The 
                         paramedics had to come and cut it 
                         loose.

               The car reacts badly.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     FREDDY
                         You can do some crazy things with 
                         it.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't know what he did to her, but 
                         she got even.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Was he all pissed off?

                                     MR. PINK
                         How would you feel if you had to do 
                         a handstand every time you took a 
                         piss.

               The car laughs.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

                                     JOE
                         You guys like to tell jokes and giggle 
                         and kid around, huh? Giggling like a 
                         bunch of young broads in a school 
                         yard. Well, let me tell a joke.

               CAMERA TRACKS ACROSS men's faces.

                                     JOE
                         Five guys sitting in a bull pen, San 
                         Quentin. Wondering how the fuck they 
                         got there. What'd we wrong? What 
                         should we've done? What didn't we 
                         do? It's your fault, my fault, his 
                         fault. All that bullshit. Finally, 
                         someone comes up with the idea, wait 
                         a minute, while we were planning 
                         this caper, all we did was sit around 
                         and tell fuckin' jokes. Got the 
                         message? When this caper's over, and 
                         I'm sure it's gonna be a successful 
                         one, hell, we'll go down to the 
                         Hawaiian Island and I'll roar and 
                         laugh with all of you. You'll find 
                         me a different character down there. 
                         Right now it's a matter of business. 
                         With the exception of Eddie and 
                         myself, who you already know, you'll 
                         be using aliases. Under no 
                         circumstances are you to tell one 
                         another your real name or anything 
                         else about yourself. That includes 
                         where you're from, your wife's name, 
                         where you might've done time, about 
                         a bank in St. Petersburg you might've 
                         robbed. You guys don't say shit about 
                         who you are, where you been or what 
                         you've done. Only thing you guys can 
                         talk about is what you're going to 
                         do. This way the only ones who know 
                         who the members of the team are Eddie 
                         and myself. And that's the way I 
                         like it. Because in the unlikely 
                         event of one of you getting 
                         apprehended by the cops, not that I 
                         expect that to happen - it most 
                         definitely should not happen - it 
                         hasn't happened, you don't have 
                         anything to deal with. You don't 
                         know any names. You know my name, 
                         you know Eddie's name. That I don't 
                         care about. You gotta prove it. I 
                         ain't worried. Besides, this way you 
                         gotta trust me. I like that. I set 
                         this up and picked the men I wanted 
                         for it. None of you came to me, I 
                         approached all of you. I know you. I 
                         know your work, I know your 
                         reputation. I know you as men. Except 
                         for this guy.

               Joe points a finger at Freddy.

               Freddy shits a brick.

                                     JOE
                         But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he 
                         wouldn't be here. Okay, let me 
                         introduce everybody to everybody. 
                         But once again, at the risk of being 
                         redundant, if I even think I hear 
                         somebody telling or referring to 
                         somebody by their Christian name...
                              (Joe searches for the 
                              right words)
                         ...you won't want to be you. Okay, 
                         quickly.
                              (pointing at the men 
                              as he gives them a 
                              name)
                         Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, 
                         Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why am I Mr. Pink?

                                     JOE
                         Cause you're a faggot, alright?

               Everybody laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why can't we pick out our own colors?

                                     JOE
                         I tried that once, it don't work. 
                         You get four guys fighting over who's 
                         gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody 
                         knows anybody else, nobody wants to 
                         back down. So forget it, I pick. Be 
                         thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too close 
                         to Mr. Shit.

               Everybody laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. 
                         Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. 
                         That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. 
                         Purple.

                                     JOE
                         You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from 
                         another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. 
                         Pink.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who cares what your name is? Who 
                         cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, 
                         Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh that's really easy for you to 
                         say, you're Mr. White. You gotta 
                         cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. 
                         White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no 
                         big deal, you wanna trade?

                                     JOE
                         Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, 
                         this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city 
                         counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. 
                         We got two ways here, my way or the 
                         highway. And you can go down either 
                         of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. 
                         Pink?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget 
                         it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, 
                         let's move on.

               CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the

                         I'll move on, when I feel like it. 
                         All you guys got the goddamn message? 
                         I'm so goddamn mad I can hardly talk. 
                         Let's go to work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

               We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

               CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on customers 
               through the windows.

               While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White 
               and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Let's go over it. Where are you?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         I stand outside and guard the door. 
                         I don't let anybody come in or go 
                         out.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Brown?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's 
                         parked across the street till I give 
                         him the signal, then he pulls up in 
                         front of the store.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Crowd control. They handle customers 
                         and employees in the display area.

               INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

               Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street 
               from the jewelry store, staking it out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Myself and Mr. Pink?

                                     FREDDY
                         You two take the manager in the back 
                         and make him give you the diamonds. 
                         We're there for those stones, period. 
                         Since no display cases are being 
                         fucked with, no alarms should go 
                         off. We're out of there in two 
                         minutes, not one second longer. What 
                         if the manager won't give up the 
                         diamonds?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         When you're dealing with a store 
                         like this, they're insured up the 
                         ass. They're not supposed to give 
                         you and resistance whatsoever. If 
                         you get a customer or an employee 
                         who thinks he's Charles Bronson, 
                         take the butt of your gun and smash 
                         their nose in. Drops 'em right to 
                         the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls 
                         down, screaming, blood squirts out 
                         his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody 
                         says fuckin' shit after that. You 
                         might get some bitch talk shit to 
                         ya. But give her a look, like you're 
                         gonna smash her in the face next. 
                         Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if 
                         it's a manager, that's a different 
                         story. The managers know better than 
                         to fuck around. So if one's givin' 
                         you static, he probably thinks he's 
                         a real cowboy. So what you gotta do 
                         is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. 
                         If you wanna know something and he 
                         won't tell you, cut off one of his 
                         fingers. The little one. Then you 
                         tell 'im his thumb's next. After 
                         that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies 
                         underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a 
                         taco.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.

               In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns FIRING, 
               people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass 
               BREAKING...

               A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

               The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

               Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING Mr. 
               Brown FALLS out.

                                     MR. BROWN
                              (screaming)
                         My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm 
                         fucking blind!

                                     FREDDY
                         You're not blind, there's just blood 
                         in your eyes.

               Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the end 
               of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

               FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the patrol 
               car.

               Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr. White's 
               ambush in shock.

               Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange, aren't 
                         you?

               By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown is 
               dead.

               Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Is he dead?

               Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Did he did or not?

               Freddy, scared.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What? Snap out of it!

               Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as he 
               RUNS.

               They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

               A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

               Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points his 
               gun at her.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Get us outta here!

               Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

               Freddy starts to climb in.

               The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         The bitch's got a gun!

               She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

               On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the 
               face.

               CLOSEUP - FREDDY

               As he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened to him 
               and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.

               Mr. White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He 
               SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

               INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is CRYING.

               We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the 
               getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Just hold on buddy boy.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed 
                         me...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. 
               Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.

               We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot 
               full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody 
               mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound. 
               Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.

                                     EDDIE
                         What the fuck happened here?

               Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde / Toothpick Vic.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         What happened?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (very weakly)
                         Blonde went crazy. He slashed the 
                         cop's face, cut off his ear and was 
                         gonna burn him alive.

                                     EDDIE
                              (yelling)
                         Who cares what he was gonna do to 
                         this fuckin' pig?

               Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and the 
               chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once 
               more.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         You were saying he went crazy? 
                         Something like that? Worse or better?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, Eddie, he was pullin' a burn. 
                         He was gonna kill the cop and me. 
                         And when you guys walked through the 
                         door, he was gonna blow you to hell 
                         and make off with the diamonds.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Eddie)
                         Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That 
                         sick piece of shit was a stone cold 
                         psycho.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (to Eddie)
                         You could've asked the cop, if you 
                         didn't just kill him. He talked about 
                         what he was going to do when he was 
                         slicing him up.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         It makes perfect fuckin' sense to 
                         me. Eddie, you didn't see how he 
                         acted during the job, we did.

               Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He's right about the ear, it's hacked 
                         off.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Let me say this out loud, just to 
                         get it straight in my mind. According 
                         to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill 
                         you. Then when we came back, kill 
                         us, grab the diamonds, and scram. 
                         That's your story? I'm correct about 
                         that, right?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Eddie, you can believe me or not 
                         believe me, but it's the truth. I 
                         swear on my mother's eternal soul 
                         that's what happened.

               The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of Nice Guy Eddie.

               There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has 
               said. Finally:

                                     EDDIE
                         The man you killed was just released 
                         from prison. He got caught at a 
                         company warehouse full of hot items. 
                         He could've walked away. All he had 
                         to do was say my dad's name. But 
                         instead he shut his mouth and did 
                         his time. He did four years for us, 
                         and he did 'em like a man. And we 
                         were very grateful. So, Mr. Orange, 
                         you're tellin' me this very good 
                         friend of mine, who did four years 
                         for my father, who in four years 
                         never made a deal, no matter what 
                         they dangled in front of him, you're 
                         telling me that now, that now this 
                         man is free, and we're making good 
                         on our commitment to him, he's just 
                         gonna decide, right out of the fuckin' 
                         blue, to rip us off?

               Silence.

                                     EDDIE
                         Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me 
                         what really happened?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Why? It'll just be more bullshit.

               Eddie steps out of his CLOSEUP and we see Joe Cabot standing 
               in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

                                     JOE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         This man set us up.

               CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's 
                         happening.

                                     JOE
                         That's okay, Eddie, I do.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Joe)
                         What the fuck are you talking about?

                                     JOE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         That piece of shit. Workin' with the 
                         cops.

                                     MR. WHITE, MR. PINK & EDDIE
                         What?

                                     JOE
                         I said this lump of shit is workin' 
                         with the LAPD.

               MR. ORANGE'S POV

               Looking up from the floor at everybody.

               Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

                                     JOE
                         Aren't you?

                                     MR. ORANGE (O.S.)
                         I don't have the slightest fuckin' 
                         idea what you're talkin' about.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (very calmly to Joe)
                         Joe, I don't know what you think you 
                         know, but you're wrong.

                                     JOE
                         Like hell I am.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (very calmly)
                         Joe, trust me on this, you've made a 
                         mistake. He's a good kid. I understand 
                         you're hot, you're super-fuckin' 
                         pissed. We're all real emotional. 
                         But you're barking up the wrong tree. 
                         I know this man, and he wouldn't do 
                         that.

                                     JOE
                         You don't know jack shit. I do. This 
                         rotten bastard tipped off the cops 
                         and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Mr. Blue's dead?

                                     JOE
                         Dead as Dillinger.

                                     EDDIE
                         The motherfucker killed Vic.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How do you know all this?

                                     JOE
                         He was the only one I wasn't a hundred 
                         percent on. I should have my fucking 
                         head examined for goin' forward when 
                         I wasn't a hundred percent. But he 
                         seemed like a good kid, and I was 
                         impatient and greedy and all the 
                         things that fuck you up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (screaming)
                         That's your proof?

                                     JOE
                         You don't need proof when you got 
                         instinct. I ignored it before, but 
                         not no more.

               He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

               Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

               Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms.

               Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

                                     EDDIE
                         Have you lost your fucking mind? Put 
                         your gun down!

               Mr. Pink fades into the b.g., wanting no part of this.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe, you're making a terrible mistake 
                         I can't let you make.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at 
                         daddy!

               Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

                                     JOE
                         Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry 
                         have been friends a long time, he 
                         ain't gonna shoot. We like each other 
                         too much.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe, if you kill that man, you die 
                         next. Repeat, if you kill that man, 
                         you die next!

               We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.

               MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

               Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

               Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off 
               him.

               Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start 
               firing any minute.

               Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr. White.

               Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

               Nobody says nothing.

               FOUR SHOT of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the 
               background.

                                     MR. PINK
                         C'mon, guys, nobody wants this. We're 
                         supposed to me fuckin' professionals!

               Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

                                     JOE
                         Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do 
                         this!

                                     JOE
                         Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on 
                         this.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Don't ask me that.

                                     JOE
                         I'm not askin', I'm betting.

               Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, don't!

               Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

               Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his hands 
               up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

               Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the 
               chest.

               Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

               The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

               Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

               Joe's dead.

               Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving. 
               The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

               Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees, not 
               moving.

               Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the satchel 
               of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

               We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP, MEN 
               RUNNING to the warehouse.

               While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand 
               but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange lies.

               He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and 
               stroking his brow.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (with much effort)
                         Sorry, kid. Looks like we're gonna 
                         do a little time.

               Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort:

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm a cop.

               Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's 
               brow.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

               Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr. 
               Orange's eyes.

               The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mr. White.

               The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see anything, 
               but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

                                     POLICE FORCE (O.S.)
                         Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your 
                         fucking gun!

               Mr. White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

               BANG!

               We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

               Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END










True Romance

by Quentin Tarantino

When you are tired of relationships, try a romance.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.

CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.

CLARENCE

In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care". Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too 'cause my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.

Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY

I'd fuck Elvis.

CLARENCE

Really?

LUCY

When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

CLARENCE

I don't blame you.

(they laugh)

So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?

Lucy laughs.

CLARENCE

Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?

LUCY

How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE

How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?

LUCY

What are we gonna see?

CLARENCE

A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".

LUCY

Who's Sonny Chiba?

CLARENCE

He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

LUCY

(not believing this)

You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?

CLARENCE

(holding up three fingers)

Three kung fu movies.

Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY

(laughing)

I don't think so, not my cup of tea.

INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.

On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. "Bewitched" is playing.

At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him.

DREXL

Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.

FLOYD

Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.

DREXL

That's bullshit.

BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags.

FLOYD

Naw man, that's some serious shit.

DREXL

Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

BIG D

What the fuck are you talkin' about?

DREXL

Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

BIG D

Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.

DREXL

I heard that.

FLOYD

Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?

BIG D

Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.

DREXL

Preach on, Big D.

FLOYD

Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.

BIG D

Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks.

DREXL

Heard that.

Drexl and Big D bump fists.

FLOYD

Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.

(he takes a hit off of a joint)

There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -

DREXL

- Because it's good!

FLOYD

Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.

BIG D

Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to express our gratitude -

Drexl and Big D bust up.

FLOYD

Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.

BIG D

So you do eat pussy!

FLOYD

Naw naw!

BIG D

You don't like it, but you eat that shit.

(to Drexl)

He eats it.

DREXL

Damn skippy. He like it, too.

BIG D

(mock English accent)

Me thinketh he doth protest too much.

FLOYD

Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!

DREXL

Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?

FLOYD

I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"

BIG D

Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -

DREXL

Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.

FLOYD

I'd say fuck it!

Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone.

Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched".

FLOYD

(yelling after them)

Ain't no man have to eat pussy!

BIG D

(not even looking)

Take that shit somewhere else.

DREXL

(marching back)

You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

FLOYD

If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.

DREXL

With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.

BIG D

(glued on TV)

I'm hip.

DREXL

In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.

Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.

DREXL

(to Floyd)

All right, check this out.

(referring to shotgun)

Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.

Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.

Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.

Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.

The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.

Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.

Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.

Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.

EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING

A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a backdrop. The song "Little Bitty Tear" is heard a capella.

INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING

Cliff Worley is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a security guard uniform.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING

Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see something that stops him short.

Cliff's POV Through windshield

Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front of his trailer.

CLOSEUP - CLIFF

Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.

BACK TO:

CLIFF'S POV

Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face through the driver's side window.

CLARENCE

Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.

INT. TRAILER HOME - MORNING

All three enter the trailer home.

CLIFF

Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected to see this morning.

Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.

CLARENCE

Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin' on thirst, you got anything to drink?

He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.

CLIFF

I think there's a Seven-Up in there.

CLARENCE

(rumaging around the fridge)

Anything stronger?

(pause)

Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

CLIFF

I can, but I don't.

CLARENCE

(closing the fridge)

That's about all I ever eat.

Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.

CLIFF

(to Girl)

I'm sorry... I'm his father.

YOUNG GIRL

(sticking her hand out)

That's OK, I'm his wife.

(shaking his hand vigorously)

Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.

She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.

Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.

CLARENCE

Oh yeah, we got married.

(referring to the magnets)

You still have these.

(to Alabama)

This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one. I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.

(to Cliff)

Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.

He hands her some money and his car keys.

CLARENCE

Go to the liquor store -

(to Cliff)

Where is there a liquor store around here?

CLIFF

Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

CLARENCE

(to Alabama)

Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?

ALABAMA

I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.

CLARENCE

Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.

(to Cliff)

What do you think would taste good?

CLIFF

I'm really not very -

CLARENCE

You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.

(to Cliff)

Where's a good chicken place around here?

CLIFF

I really don't know.

CLARENCE

You don't know the chicken places around where you live?

(to Alabama)

Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.

He gives her some more money.

CLARENCE

This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.

ALABAMA

Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.

She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.

CLARENCE

Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?

CLIFF

She seems very nice.

CLARENCE

Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -

CLIFF

Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?

CLARENCE

Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.

BLACK TITLE CARD: "HOLLYWOOD"

INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER - DAY

FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip board in hand.

RAVENCROFT

Dick Ritchie?

Dick pops up from the pack.

DICK

I'm me... I mean, that's me.

RAVENCROFT

Step inside.

INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several posters advertising "The Return of T.J. Hooker" hang on the wall.

Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.

RAVENCROFT

Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.

(she picks a up a copy of the script)

Whenever you're ready.

DICK

(reading and miming driving)

Where'd you come from?

RAVENCROFT

(reading from the script lifelessly)

I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK

(reading from script)

Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

She puts her script down, and smiles at him.

RAVENCROFT

That was very good.

DICK

Thank you.

RAVENCROFT

If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?

DICK

Sure. No problem.

RAVENCROFT

Could we try it now?

DICK

Absolutely.

Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.

DICK

Where'd he come from?

RAVENCROFT

(monotone, as before)

I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK

Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

Ravencroft puts her script down.

RAVENCROFT

Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.

Dick smiles.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what Clarence has told him.

CLARENCE

Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.

CLIFF

You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -

(raising his voice)

- I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!

Cliff pauses and collects himself.

CLIFF

What do you want from me?

CLARENCE

What?

CLIFF

Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?

CLARENCE

Do you still have friends on the force?

CLIFF

Yes, I still have friends on the force.

CLARENCE

Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.

(pause)

Daddy?

CLIFF

What makes you think I could do that?

CLARENCE

You were a cop.

CLIFF

What makes you think I would do that?

CLARENCE

I'm your son.

CLIFF

You got it all worked out, don't you?

CLARENCE

Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.

ALABAMA

The forager's back.

CLARENCE

Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.

ALABAMA

I didn't get any chicken.

CLARENCE

How come?

ALABAMA

It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.

INT. TRAILER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.

We see both inside the conversation.

CLIFF

It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

WILSON

What about him?

CLIFF

Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.

WILSON

Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?

CLIFF

Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?

WILSON

McTeague.

CLIFF

I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?

WILSON

I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?

CLIFF

You and Robin moved?

WILSON

Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.

CLIFF

They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

CLARENCE

Do tell. Why drug related?

CLIFF

Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.

CLARENCE

No shit?

CLIFF

Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?

CLARENCE

Nope.

CLIFF

If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.

CLARENCE

Who is he?

CLIFF

Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.

CLARENCE

That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?

CLIFF

Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.

Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.

CLARENCE

Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.

CLIFF

I got some money I can give you -

CLARENCE

Keep it.

CLIFF

Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.

CLARENCE

We do make a cute couple, don't we?

CLIFF

Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.

(pause)

I love you son.

They hug each other,

Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.

CLARENCE

This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but you can get a hold of me through him.

Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.

CLARENCE

Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,

Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's bubbling like a Fresca.

ALABAMA

Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.

CLARENCE

(mock anger)

What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?

ALABAMA

Oh, hush up.

The two get into the Mustang.

CLARENCE

(to Cliff)

We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.

Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.

CLIFF

Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.

ALABAMA

Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.

Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.

CLARENCE

(to Cliff)

As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time when we will all be together again.

Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.

As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.

CLIFF

The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet dancer's feet hangs on the wall.

The phone rings, Dick answers.

DICK

Hi, Dick here.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LAS VEGAS - SUNSET

Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.

Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.

CLARENCE

(big bopper voice)

Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!

Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation.

DICK

(unsure)

Clarence?

CLARENCE

You got it.

DICK

It's great to hear from you.

CLARENCE

Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.

DICK

You comin' to L.A.? When?

CLARENCE

Tomorrow.

DICK

What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?

Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.

CLARENCE

Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.

DICK

Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE

I'm a married man.

DICK

Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE

Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?

Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.

ALABAMA

Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.

DICK

Hello, Alabama.

ALABAMA

I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.

Clarence start dictating to her what to say.

CLARENCE

Tell him we gotta go.

ALABAMA

Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.

DICK

What?

CLARENCE

Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.

ALABAMA

He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.

DICK

Wait a minute -

CLARENCE

Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.

ALABAMA

Don't eat anything.

DICK

Alabama, could you tell Clar -

CLARENCE

Ask him if he got the letter.

ALABAMA

Did you get the letter?

DICK

What letter?

ALABAMA

(to Clarence)

What letter?

CLARENCE

The letter I sent.

ALABAMA

(to Dick)

The letter he sent.

DICK

Clarence sent a letter?

CLARENCE

Has he gotten his mail today?

ALABAMA

Gotten your mail yet?

DICK

Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.

ALABAMA

(to Clarence)

Yes.

CLARENCE

Has he looked through it yet?

ALABAMA

(to Dick)

Ya looked through it?

DICK

Not yet.

ALABAMA

(to Clarence)

Nope.

CLARENCE

Tell him to look through it.

ALABAMA

(to Dick)

Get it.

DICK

Let me speak to Clarence.

ALABAMA

(to Clarence)

He wants to speak with you.

CLARENCE

No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.

ALABAMA

(to Dick)

He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.

DICK

Money problems?

CLARENCE

Now tell him goodbye.

ALABAMA

Bye-bye.

CLARENCE

Now hang up.

She hangs up the phone.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dick hears the click on the other end.

DICK

Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?

Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks up the day's mail. He goes through it.

BILL: Southern California Gas Company.

BILL: Group W.

BILL: Fossenkemp Photography.

BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.

LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.

EXT. TRAILER - DAY

A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet.

A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.

INT. TRAILER - DAY

He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.

GUN CARRIER (DARIO)

Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.

Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type).

Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.

Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.

COCCOTTI

(to Frankie)

Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.

In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.

Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

COCCOTTI

Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

CLIFF

I give up. Who are you?

COCCOTTI

I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?

CLIFF

I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

COCCOTTI

I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.

(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)

Want a Chesterfield?

CLIFF

No.

COCCOTTI

(as he lights up)

I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.

CLIFF

Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -

Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist.

COCCOTTI

Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?

Cliff's defeated.

CLIFF

I've seen him.

COCCOTTI

Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.

CLIFF

What are you talkin' about?

COCCOTTI

I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.

CLIFF

I don't believe you.

COCCOTTI

That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?

CLIFF

On their honeymoon.

COCCOTTI

I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?

CLIFF

They didn't tell me.

Coccotti looks at him.

CLIFF

Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask.

Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.

Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.

Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car.

Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.

COCCOTTI

Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away from.

The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.

CLIFF

Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?

COCCOTTI

Sure.

Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.

CLIFF

Got a match?

Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.

CLIFF

Oh, don't bother. I got one.

(he lights the cigarette)

So you're a Sicilian, huh?

COCCOTTI

(intensly)

Uh-huh.

CLIFF

You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.

COCCOTTI

Come again?

CLIFF

It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?

Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head.

He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men.

COCCOTTI

I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good.

Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about.

Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer. When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)".

LENNY

Boss, get ready to get happy.

TITLE CARD: "CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A."

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT- MORNING

Dick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His room-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.

The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing in his doorway.

Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon.

CLARENCE/ALABAMA

Hello my baby, Hello my honey, Hello my ragtime gal -

DICK

Hi guys.

Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she breaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick and into his apartment.

CLARENCE

Wow. Neat place.

INT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - DAY

The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the ultimate masterpiece hot-dog.

EXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - PATIO - DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on chili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.

ALABAMA

... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.

CLARENCE

And here we are.

DICK

That's a pretty amazing story.

CLARENCE

Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?

DICK

Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.

CLARENCE

You goin' out?

DICK

Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.

CLARENCE

Good for you.

DICK

What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.

ALABAMA

You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?

DICK

Knock wood.

He knocks the table and then looks at it.

DICK

... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.

CLARENCE

Did you meet Captain Kirk?

DICK

You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.

ALABAMA

(finishing her hot-dog)

That was so good I am gonna have another.

DICK

You can't have just one.

Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.

DICK

How much of that letter was on the up and up?

CLARENCE

Every word of it.

Dick sees where Clarence's attention is.

DICK

You're really in love, aren't you?

CLARENCE

For the very first time in my life.

(pause)

Do you know what that's like?

Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.

DICK

(regretfully)

No, I don't

(he looks at Alabama)

How did you two meet?

Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.

CLARENCE

Do you remember The Lyric?

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT

Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.

Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT

A cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the triple feature: "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter" and "Sister Streetfighter". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.

A box office girl reading comic looks at her.

ALABAMA

One please.

BOX OFFICE GIRL

Ninety-nine cents.

ALABAMA

Which one is on now?

BOX OFFICE GIRL

"Return of the Streetfighter". It's been on about forty-five minutes.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT

Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A young usher takes care of her.

ALABAMA

Can I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of Goobers.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT

It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-comers.

Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick scan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.

Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.

When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.

ALABAMA

Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

CLARENCE

Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

ALABAMA

I'm the clumsiest person in the world.

CLARENCE

(picking popcorn out of his hair)

It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.

ALABAMA

(picking popcorn out of his hair)

What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.

Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.

Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into the movie.

They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder.

ALABAMA

Excuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling me in on what I missed?

Jumping on this opportunity.

CLARENCE

Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.

ALABAMA

The oriental.

CLARENCE

The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.

ALABAMA

Want some Goobers?

CLARENCE

Thanks a lot.

ALABAMA

I thought Sonny was the good guy.

CLARENCE

He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.

They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.

TIME CUT:

On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him. THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.

The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence. They're both applauding.

ALABAMA

Great movie. Action-packed!

CLARENCE

Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

ALABAMA

Sonny kicks ass.

CLARENCE

You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.

ALABAMA

If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.

CLARENCE

My name is Clarence, and what is yours?

ALABAMA

Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.

CLARENCE

Is that your real name? Really?

ALABAMA

That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.

She shows Clarence her driver's license.

CLARENCE

Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.

(announcer voice)

She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up laughing.

CLARENCE

Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

ALABAMA

I took a cab.

CLARENCE

You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?

ALABAMA

Sure. Why not?

CLARENCE

Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.

ALABAMA

What time is it?

CLARENCE

'Bout twelve.

ALABAMA

I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?

CLARENCE

No. Not particularly.

(pause)

How come?

ALABAMA

Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?

CLARENCE

I love to get pie after a movie.

ALABAMA

Would you like to get some pie?

CLARENCE

I'd love some pie.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about 12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke. Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.

CLARENCE

Well, enough about the King. How about you?

ALABAMA

How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE

Tell me about yourself.

ALABAMA

There's nothing to tell.

CLARENCE

C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?

ALABAMA

What do you want to know?

CLARENCE

Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.

ALABAMA

Ask me them again. One by one.

CLARENCE

What do you do?

ALABAMA

I don't remember.

CLARENCE

Where are you from.

ALABAMA

Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

CLARENCE

What's your favorite color?

ALABAMA

I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.

CLARENCE

What's your favorite movie star?

ALABAMA

Burt Reynolds.

CLARENCE

Would you like a bite of my pie?

ALABAMA

Yes, I would.

Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.

CLARENCE

Like it?

ALABAMA

Very much. Now, where were we?

CLARENCE

What kinda music do you like?

ALABAMA

Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".

CLARENCE

What are your turn-ons?

ALABAMA

Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

CLARENCE

Turn-offs?

ALABAMA

I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.

CLARENCE

Do you have a fella?

She looks at Clarence and smiles.

ALABAMA

I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

CLARENCE

What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?

ALABAMA

Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.

CLARENCE

And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

ALABAMA

Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.

Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.

A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

ALABAMA

Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?

(eats her last piece of pie)

Where to next?

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-cool.

ALABAMA

Wow. What a swell place to work.

CLARENCE

Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.

ALABAMA

How long have you worked here?

CLARENCE

Almost four years.

ALABAMA

That's a long time.

CLARENCE

I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

ALABAMA

Do you get paid a lot?

CLARENCE

That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?

ALABAMA

You bet. How much is that worth?

Clarence gets a box off the shelf.

CLARENCE

Four hundred bucks.

ALABAMA

I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.

CLARENCE

Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.

She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.

ALABAMA

What's that?

CLARENCE

That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.

He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box.

CLARENCE

"Spiderman", number one. The one that started it all.

Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

ALABAMA

God, Spiderman looks different.

CLARENCE

He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.

He pulls out another comic.

CLARENCE

"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos". One of the coolest series known to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.

(he opens one up)

Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at this one.

We see the "Sgt. Fury" panels.

CLARENCE

Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't that cool?

She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.

CLARENCE

Alabama, I'd like you to have this.

Clarence hands her the "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos" comic book that he loves so much.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.

ALABAMA

What a cool room!

She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.

Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album. Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.

ALABAMA

Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?

CLARENCE

Five.

She turns the page.

ALABAMA

Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

CLARENCE

I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

LATER - LIVING ROOM

Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart".

CLARENCE

You know when you sat behind me?

ALABAMA

At the movies?

CLARENCE

Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.

ALABAMA

What would make you think that?

CLARENCE

I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

ALABAMA

You're not stupid. Just wrong.

They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song.

ALABAMA

I love Janis.

CLARENCE

You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.

ALABAMA

She OD'd, didn't she?

CLARENCE

Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.

ALABAMA

You mean she got a bad batch?

CLARENCE

That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

ALABAMA

So he really loved her?

CLARENCE

Uh-huh.

They kiss.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.

CLARENCE

What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?

ALABAMA

You didn't do nothing.

CLARENCE

Did you hurt yourself?

(he takes her foot)

Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?

ALABAMA

Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.

CLARENCE

What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.

ALABAMA

I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.

Pause.

CLARENCE

You're a whore?

ALABAMA

I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.

(pause)

I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.

CLARENCE

"Heroes For Sale"?

ALABAMA

Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

CLARENCE

Who?

ALABAMA

I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.

CLARENCE

That dazzling imagination.

ALABAMA

It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."

CLARENCE

Who and what is a Drexl?

ALABAMA

My pimp.

CLARENCE

You have a pimp?

ALABAMA

Uh-huh.

CLARENCE

A real live pimp?

ALABAMA

Uh-huh.

CLARENCE

Is he black?

ALABAMA

He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.

CLARENCE

Is he nice?

ALABAMA

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.

CLARENCE

What did he do to Arlene?

ALABAMA

Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.

CLARENCE

This motherfucker sounds charming!

Clarence is on his feet, furious.

CLARENCE

Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?

ALABAMA

At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.

CLARENCE

Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?

ALABAMA

What?

CLARENCE

Will you be my wife?

When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.

ALABAMA

Yes.

CLARENCE

(a little surprised)

You will?

ALABAMA

You better not be fucking teasing me.

CLARENCE

You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.

They seal it with a kiss.

LATER - THAT NIGHT

CLOSEUP - Alabama's wedding ring.

The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie they're watching is "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks down to admre the ring on her hand.

CLARENCE

Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?

ALABAMA

I don't believe so.

CLARENCE

Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.

We hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:

TV ANNOUNCER

(off)

We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after these important messages...

Clarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his. We see commercials playing.

He turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.

He smiles and turns back to the TV.

More commercials.

Dolly close on Clarence's face

FLASH ON:

Alabama, right after he proposed.

ALABAMA

You better not be fucking teasing me.

FLASH ON:

In a cute, all-night wedding chapel. Clarence dressed in a rented tuxedo and Alabama in a rented white wedding gown.

ALABAMA

I do.

CLARENCE

Thank you.

FLASH ON:

Clarence and Alabama, dressed in tux and gown, doing a lover's waltz on a ballroom dance floor.

FLASH ON:

Clarence and Alabama in a taxi cab.

CLARENCE

Hello, Mrs. Worley.

ALABAMA

How do you do, Mr. Worley?

CLARENCE

Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

ALABAMA

Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?

CLARENCE

Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.

ALABAMA

Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?

Moving on top of her.

CLARENCE

Not for me.

He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.

ALABAMA

(playfully)

No no no no no no no no no...

CLARENCE

(playfully)

Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...

FLASH ON:

A big mean-looking black man in pimp's clothes.

PIMP

Bitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.

Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to a potential customer.

PIMP

I'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine. This girl's a freak! You can fuck 'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth. Rough stuff, too. She's a freak for it. Jus' try not to fuck 'er up for life.

FLASH ON:

Pimp beating Alabama.

PIMP

You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn!

FLASH ON:

Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp.

PIMP

Hang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit.

BACK TO:

TV showing kung fu film.

BACK TO:

Clarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes.

Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled by his sudden movement.

ALABAMA

(yelling after him)

Where you goin', honey?

CLARENCE

(off)

I just gotta get somethin'.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep polluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.

FAMILIAR VOICE

(off)

Well? Can you live with it?

Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.

CLARENCE

What?

ELVIS

Can you live with it?

CLARENCE

Live with what?

ELVIS

With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?

CLARENCE

Yeah.

ELVIS

You wanna get unhaunted?

CLARENCE

Yeah.

ELVIS

Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

CLARENCE

I can't believe what you're tellin' me.

ELVIS

I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

CLARENCE

You'd really do that?

ELVIS

He don't got no right to live.

CLARENCE

Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.

ELVIS

I don't blame you.

CLARENCE

If I thought I could get away with it -

ELVIS

Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

Clarence looks at Elvis.

ELVIS

Clarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

CLOSEUP - A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his heavy athletic sock.

INT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Clarence returns.

CLARENCE

Sweetheart, write down your former address.

ALABAMA

What?

CLARENCE

Write down Drexl's address.

ALABAMA

Why?

CLARENCE

So I can go over there and pick up your things.

ALABAMA

(really scared)

No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.

He kneels down before her and holds her hand.

CLARENCE

Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?

ALABAMA

You don't know him -

CLARENCE

You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.

TITLE CARD: "CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT"

EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET - NIGHT

It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration.

CLARENCE

(in Elvis voice)

Yeah... Yeah...

He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.

INT. DARK BUILDING - NIGHT

He's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.

A Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.

YOUNG BLACK MAN

You want somethin'?

CLARENCE

Drexl?

YOUNG BLACK MAN

Naw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?

CLARENCE

I gotta talk to Drexl.

MARTY

Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him?

CLARENCE

It's about Alabama.

A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our friend, Drexl Spivey.

DREXL

Where the fuck is that bitch?

CLARENCE

She's with me.

DREXL

Who the fuck are you?

CLARENCE

I'm her husband.

DREXL

Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.

INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.

DREXL

(to Marty)

What was I sayin'?

MARTY

Rock whores.

DREXL

You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.

Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.

DREXL

(to Clarence)

You know what I'm talkin' about.

Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned Hookers lounging about the apartment.

DREXL

(to Marty)

These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.

Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.

DREXL

Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.

MARTY

Pussy love pink rocks.

This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention.

DREXL

(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)

Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.

CLARENCE

No thanks.

DREXL

No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.

CLARENCE

I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much. Not one penny more, not one penny more.

You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

DREXL

It's empty.

Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole."

Silence.

DREXL

Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand -

Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.

Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold.

Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.

All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.

Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.

Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.

Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.

DREXL

Ya wanna fuck with me?

(hits Clarence)

Ya wanna fuck with me?

(hits Clarence)

I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!

He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.

Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.

Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.

Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.

Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.

Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.

Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.

Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.

Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.

Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.

Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.

Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.

DREXL

(to Marty)

You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?

MARTY

Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.

DREXL

(to Clarence)

You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.

(to Marty)

I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.

(laughing)

He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?

MARTY

(laughing)

Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.

DREXL

(to Clarence)

Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.

CLARENCE

(hurting)

Wannabee nigger...

DREXL

Fuck you! My mother was Apache.

Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.

Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.

Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.

Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.

DREXL

Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost like a nigger name.

(to Clarence)

Hey, dummy.

He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.

DREXL

Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you are, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street, apartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.

He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.

DREXL

(to Marty)

I'll keep lover boy here entertained.

(to Clarence)

You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.

(hollering to Marty)

Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?

MARTY

(off)

I'm tryin' to find my jacket.

DREXL

Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.

While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.

Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.

MARTY

(off)

What's happening?

Marty steps into the room.

Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.

Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.

Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick.

Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.

CLARENCE

Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!

She doesn't move.

CLARENCE

You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!

The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.

Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug.

CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.

Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.

CLARENCE

(to Drexl)

Open you eyes, laughing boy.

He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.

CLARENCE

Open your eyes!

He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.

CLARENCE

You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?

He fires.

CLOSEUP - The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:

CLARENCE

I killed him.

She stops short.

CLARENCE

I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.

Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch.

Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.

CLARENCE

Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of everythin'.

He stops and looks at here.

CLARENCE

I am so hungry.

He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.

ALABAMA

(in a daze)

Was it him or you?

CLARENCE

Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.

ALABAMA

Is this a joke?

CLARENCE

No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.

CLARENCE

Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.

She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on her, yelling:

CLARENCE

Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it had been me? Do you love him?

(no answer)

Do you love him?

(no answer)

Do you love him?

She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.

ALABAMA

I think what you did was...

CLARENCE

What?

ALABAMA

I think what you did...

CLARENCE

What?

ALABAMA

... was so romantic.

Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.

CLARENCE

I gotta get outta these clothes.

He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.

ALABAMA

(comically)

Clean clothes. There is a god,

Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.

ALABAMA

Clarence. Those aren't my clothes.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY

We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY

CLOSEUP - Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.

CLOSEUP - The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of cocaine!

Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.

Alabama's watching the cable TV.

DICK

Holy Mary, Mother of God.

ALABAMA

This is great, we got cable.

CLARENCE

(to Alabama)

Bama, you got your blade?

Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine.

He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.

DICK

This shit can't be real.

CLARENCE

It'll get ya high.

He tosses the knife.

CLARENCE

Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

ALABAMA

Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.

DICK

It's fuckin' real!

(to Clarence)

It's fuckin' real!

CLARENCE

I certainly hope so.

DICK

You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!

CLARENCE

I know.

DICK

Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?

CLARENCE

Tell me.

DICK

I don't know! A fuckin' lot!

He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.

DICK

This is Drexl's coke?

CLARENCE

Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?

DICK

Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.

Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.

CLARENCE

But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.

DICK

Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -

CLARENCE

No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.

DICK

Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?

CLARENCE

I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?

DICK

It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.

CLARENCE

Is he big league?

DICK

He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.

CLARENCE

What'd'ya tell 'em?

DICK

Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.

CLARENCE

What's this acting class guy's name?

DICK

Elliot.

CLARENCE

Elliot what?

DICK

Elliot Blitzer.

CLARENCE

OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.

DICK

Where?

CLARENCE

(to Alabama)

The zoo.

CLARENCE

(to Dick)

The zoo.

(pause)

What are you waiting for?

DICK

Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?

CLARENCE

What's to think about?

DICK

Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.

CLARENCE

Two guys.

DICK

Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.

CLARENCE

Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.

Dick rests his head in his hands.

CLARENCE

Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need you to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea, and get your friend to the phone.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - DAY

CLOSEUP - A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth.

Clarence, Alabama, Dick and Elliot Blitzer are walking through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.

ELLIOT

So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -

CLARENCE

Want an animal cracker?

ELLIOT

Yeah, OK.

He takes one.

CLARENCE

Leave the gorillas.

ELLIOT

- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -

CLARENCE

Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

DICK

(trying to chill him out)

Clarence...

ELLIOT

Where did you get it?

CLARENCE

I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.

ELLIOT

(forcing a laugh)

Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

CLARENCE

Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -

ELLIOT

(turning to Dick)

Look, Dick, I don't -

CLARENCE

(laughing)

No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

ELLIOT

What department?

CLARENCE

What do you think, eightball?

ELLIOT

The police department?

CLARENCE

Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.

ELLIOT

He trusts you?

CLARENCE

We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.

ELLIOT

Sure. I didn't hear anything.

Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion. Alabama is forever blowing bubbles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting around a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks. Alabama is still blowing bubbles.

CLARENCE

(to Elliot)

Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?

Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean.

ELLIOT

What?

CLARENCE

Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?

ELLIOT

(with conviction)

No. No, you don't.

CLARENCE

Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?

DICK

Clarence...

CLARENCE

(to Dick)

Let me handle this.

ELLIOT

Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.

CLARENCE

Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.

Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement.

INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY

Movie producer, Lee Donowitz, is driving his Porsche through the winding Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone rings, he answers.

LEE

Hello.

(pause)

Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough of you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always call me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

Elliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence. Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles.

ELLIOT

(on phone)

I'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what I'm talking about, Lee?

BACK TO:

LEE

Store-fronts whiz by in the background.

LEE

Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT

Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you.

BACK TO:

LEE

In the 7th street tunnel. Lee's voice echoes.

LEE

Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT

You said if I didn't get you on the -

Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand.

CLARENCE

(into phone)

Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet.

EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.

VIRGIL

Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?

FLOYD

Naw, he ain't home right now.

VIRGIL

Do you live here?

FLOYD

Yeah, I live here.

VIRGIL

Sorta room-mates?

FLOYD

Exactly room-mates.

VIRGIL

Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?

FLOYD

Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.

VIRGIL

How do you know? You been there?

FLOYD

No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.

VIRGIL

You're right. It is.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - PAYPHONE - DAY

Clarence is still on the phone with Lee.

CLARENCE

Lee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open "Doctor Zhivago" in L.A. And I want you to distribute it.

BACK TO:

LEE

Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

LEE

I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.

BACK TO:

LEE

He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.

LEE

I'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all about. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies. Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end helps me on many levels.

Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.

LEE

(continuing)

But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE

Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.

BACK TO:

LEE

Speeding down a benchside road.

LEE

Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.

Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.

CLARENCE

(to Elliot)

He wants to talk ya.

ELLIOT

(into phone)

Mr. Donowitz?

(pause)

I told you, through Dick.

(pause)

He's in my acting class.

(pause)

About a year.

(pause)

Yeah, he's good.

(pause)

They grew up together.

(pause)

Sure thing.

Elliot hangs up the phone.

ELLIOT

He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.

(pointing to Clarence)

He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.

CLARENCE

No problems on both counts.

He offers Elliot the animal crackers.

CLARENCE

Have a cookie.

Elliot takes one.

ELLIOT

Thanks.

He puts it in the mouth.

CLARENCE

That wasn't a gorilla, was it?

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY

The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama hops out. Clarence stays in.

ALABAMA

You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?

CLARENCE

Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

ALABAMA

I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.

CLARENCE

You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.

ALABAMA

I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.

They kiss.

CLARENCE

We now return to "Bullit" already in progress.

He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her little walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she turns to them.

ALABAMA

Thank you.

She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY

She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.

VIRGIL

(calmly)

Step inside and shut the door.

She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.

VIRGIL

(calmly)

Lady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.

VIRGIL

Step away from the door, move into the bathroom.

She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.

VIRGIL

OK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming back.

ALABAMA

I think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke, but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but maybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he plays football. Al Lylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.

Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL

You're cute.

Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY

Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.

CLARENCE

(singing)

"Land of stardust, land of glamour, Vistavision and Cinema, Everything about it is a must, To get to Hollywood, or bust..."

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY

Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.

VIRGIL

Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in. Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get on your feet, Fruitloop.

Alabama wobbily complies.

VIRGIL

Where's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?

Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to kill her.

ALABAMA

Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.

Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours gasping for air that's just not there.

Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag.

VIRGIL

Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY

Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.

CLARENCE

Woah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest hamburger you guys got?

The Iranian Guy at the counter says:

IRANIAN GUY

That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.

CLARENCE

Well, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two large Diet Cokes.

(looking at a menu at the wall)

And I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY

Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself against the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.

VIRGIL

You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you? Dream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my fuckin' coke?

She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her head slams into the left side of the wall.

VIRGIL

Where's Clarence?!

Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side. Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.

VIRGIL

When's Clarence getting back?

She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the middle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL

You gotta lot of heart, kid.

He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY

CLOSEUP - Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.

Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of "Newsweek" with Elvis on the cover.

CLARENCE

That's a great issue.

The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.

CUSTOMER

Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.

CLARENCE

Have you read the story on Elvis?

CUSTOMER

No. Not yet.

CLARENCE

You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.

CUSTOMER

That good, huh?

He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the Elvis article.

CLARENCE

It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.

CUSTOMER

I can see what you mean.

CLARENCE

Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.

Clarence and the Customer laugh.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY

Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.

VIRGIL

Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now, the second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to hoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.

He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there.

Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind.

VIRGIL

Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great. One less thing I gotta worry about.

Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.

She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.

VIRGIL

OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth -

Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-man smiles.

VIRGIL

Kid, you got a lotta heart.

He moves toward her.

Alabama's hands are shaking.

VIRGIL

Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only do that for people I like.

He moves close.

Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere.

VIRGIL

Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it.

(giggling)

You don't have anything to lose.

CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred.

Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.

CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE

Talk about bloodcurling yells.

Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.

While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.

Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.

VIRGIL

OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.

Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.

Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.

Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.

VIRGIL

What's so fuckin' funny?!!

ALABAMA

(laughing)

You look so ridiculous.

She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.

VIRGIL

Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you laughing now?

Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.

Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.

Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.

VIRGIL

Oh Jesus!

She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.

VIRGIL

Oh Mary, help me!

The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.

He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.

Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.

The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.

Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.

He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.

Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.

Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.

Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.

He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.

Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.

He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.

Alabama snatches the shotgun.

Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.

The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.

Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.

Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.

ALABAMA

Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.

CLARENCE

Honey?

She continues. He puts his gun away.

CLARENCE

Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,

She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.

Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY

Everybody is outside their rooms watching as Clarence walks through the pool area with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.

EXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY

Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's muttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other strokes Alabama's hair.

CLARENCE

Sleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than this. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.

EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT

A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.

INT. MOTEL 6 - CLARENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed.

INT. NOWHERE

Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a headshot.

CLARENCE

I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'. But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that lady again.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

A wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance we hear the roar of a car engine.

EXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

Vaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick corners, pushing it to the edge.

INT. MOVING PORSCHE - NIGHT

Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy Coke Whore is sitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue light flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.

ELLIOT

Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!

(he pulls over)

Kandi, you gotta help me.

KANDI

What can I do?

He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.

ELLIOT

You gotta hold this for me.

KANDI

You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.

ELLIOT

(frantically)

Just put it in your purse.

KANDI

I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

ELLIOT

They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.

KANDI

No way, JosÈ.

ELLIOT

Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.

KANDI

I'm not wearing a bra.

ELLIOT

(pleading)

Put it in your pants.

KANDI

No.

ELLIOT

You're the one who wanted to drive fast.

KANDI

Read my lips.

She mouths the word "no".

ELLIOT

After all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!

She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine completely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing beam. Tears fill his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him. They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.

NICHOLSON

Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -

DIMES

Not a tiny little vial -

NICHOLSON

But a fuckin' baggie.

DIMES

No don't sit here and feed us some shit.

NICHOLSON

You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -

DIMES

You're no longer an extra -

NICHOLSON

Or a bit player -

DIMES

Or a supporting actor -

NICHOLSON

You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -

DIMES

But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -

NICHOLSON

And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.

DIMES

'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -

NICHOLSON

That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.

Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission accomplished.

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE - DAY

CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends about seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain.

KRINKLE

Nicholson! Dimes! Het in here!

The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.

DIMES

Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it was all over -

NICHOLSON

Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -

KRINKLE

Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?

DIMES

Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.

NICHOLSON

Nicholson and I.

DIMES

Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.

NICHOLSON

Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.

DIMES

So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. Four wise-guy Hoods, one older, the other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.

COCCOTTI

- And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never shows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole and what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)

You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?

COCCOTTI

It's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But after that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)

What happened?

OLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)

Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he served three.

COCCOTTI

Anybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him personally, he's OK.

BACK TO:

KRINKLE'S OFFICE

NICHOLSON

It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for a year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo -

DIMES

Suspect's words -

NICHOLSON

To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

DIMES

He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".

KRINKLE

That Vietnam movie?

DIMES

Uh-huh.

KRINKLE

That was a good fuckin' movie.

DIMES

Sure was.

KRINKLE

Do you believe him?

DIMES

I believe he believes him.

NICHOLSON

He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.

DIMES

This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.

KRINKLE

He'll wear a wire?

DIMES

We talked him into it.

KRINKLE

Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.

DIMES

Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.

NICHOLSON

Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way. And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.

BACK TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

YOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)

Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.

LENNY

Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.

(to Marvin)

Do you know Nick Cardella?

MARVIN

No.

LENNY

Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?

MARVIN

I didn't mean -

LENNY

Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.

COCCOTTI

Children, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot. So you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.

TITLE CARD: "THE BIG DAY"

EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway. As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the LAX Airport runways, where planes are taking off and landing. A plane takes off, and they stop and watch.

CLARENCE

Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.

ALABAMA

Really?

CLARENCE

With a vengeance, I hated them.

ALABAMA

How come?

CLARENCE

I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.

ALABAMA

What?

CLARENCE

Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.

Another plane takes off.

CLARENCE

But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.

ALABAMA

You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.

CLARENCE

I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?

ALABAMA

Cancoon.

CLARENCE

Why Cancoon?

ALABAMA

It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?

CLARENCE

But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.

They kiss.

CLARENCE

Don't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve it.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal. Floyd lays on the couch watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses because of the black eye she has.

CLARENCE

(to Floyd)

You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire?

FLOYD

I've partied there twice. Yeah, I'm sure.

DICK

Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.

(to Clarence)

Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.

CLARENCE

I'm just makin' sure we got everything.

(pointing to Alabama)

You got yours?

She holds up the suitcase. The phone rings. The three pile out the door. Floyd picks up the phone.

FLOYD

Hello?

He puts his hand over the receiver.

FLOYD

Dick, it's for you. You here?

DICK

No. I left.

He starts to close the door then opens it again.

DICK

I'll take it.

(he takes the receiver)

Hello.

(pause)

Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out the -

(pause)

Really?

(pause)

I don't believe it.

(pause)

She really said that?

(pause)

I'll be by first thing.

(pause)

No, thank you for sending me out.

(pause)

Bye-bye.

He hangs up and looks to Clarence.

DICK

(stunned)

I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".

CLARENCE

No shit? Dick, that's great!

Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles.

DICK

(still stunned)

They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.

CLARENCE

Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.

Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go.

DICK

Clarence.

CLARENCE

Yeah?

DICK

Um, nothing, let's go?

They exit.

EXT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL - DAY

We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape.

INT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is sitting on a bed.

Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun. He goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells.

Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun.

The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a couple of .45 automatics in his hands.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP S' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Nicholson and Dimes and FOUR DETECTIVES from internal affairs are in a room on the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire on Elliot.

DIMES

OK, say something.

ELLIOT

(talking loud into the wire)

Hello! Hello! Hello! How now brown cow!

NICHOLSON

Just talk regular.

ELLIOT

(normal tone)

"But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief -"

DIMES

Are you gettin' this shit?

DETECTIVE BY TAPE MACHINE Clear as a bell.

Nicholson, Dime, and the head IA Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot.

DIMES

Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall.

ELLIOT

And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in.

NICHOLSON

Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.

DIMES

We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.

NICHOLSON

So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.

WURLITZER

And this fellow Clarence?

ELLIOT

Yeah, Clarence.

WURLITZER

You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this.

ELLIOT

I'll try.

DIMES

You do more than try.

NICHOLSON

You do.

DIMES

Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY

Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route.

DICK

You got that playing basketball?

ALABAMA

Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.

They stop at a red light. Clarence looks at Alabama.

CLARENCE

Red light means love, baby.

He and Alabama start kissing.

INT. MOVING CADILLAC - DAY

Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE PARKING LOT - DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang. Dick takes the suitcase.

CLARENCE

I'll take that. Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking.

Clarence takes out his .38. Dick reacts. They walk and talk.

DICK

What the fuck did you bring that for.

CLARENCE

In case.

DICK

In case of what?

CLARENCE

In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?

DICK

Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -

CLARENCE

I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.

Pause. Clarence stops walking.

CLARENCE

Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared. What say we forget the whole thing.

Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.

DICK

Do you really mean it?

CLARENCE

No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?

ALABAMA

I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.

CLARENCE

It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.

DICK

Now's a helluva time to play "what if".

CLARENCE

This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.

ALABAMA

It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.

CLARENCE

That rhymes.

He kisses her.

DICK

Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.

CLARENCE

Yeah, let's just get outta here.

The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two climb in. Clarence hops back out.

CLARENCE

I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away. I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man who can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let the chips fall where they may.

Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY

Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself.

ELLIOT

(singing)

There's a man who leads a life of danger, To everyone he meets he stays a stranger. Be careful what you say, you'll give yourself away...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape machine. Coming from the machine:

ELLIOT'S VOICE

(off)

... odds are you won't live to see tomorrow, secret agent man, secret agent man....

Nicholson looks at Dimes.

DIMES

Why, all of the sudden, have I got a bad feeling?

BACK TO:

LOBBY

Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase. He spots Elliot and goes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself, quietly:

ELLIOT

Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.

Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.

ELLIOT

Where's everybody else?

CLARENCE

They'll be along.

Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot.

ELLIOT

Hi, Dick.

DICK

How you doin', Elliot?

CLARENCE

Well, I guess it's about that time.

ELLIOT

I guess so. Follow me.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY

The four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the car to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing. They are all silent.

CLARENCE

Elliot.

ELLIOT

Yeah?

CLARENCE

Get on your knees.

Not sure he heard him right.

ELLIOT

What?

Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his .38.

CLARENCE

I said get on your fuckin' knees.

Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react.

CLARENCE

Shut up, both of you, I know what I'm doin'.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Pandemonium.

DIMES

He knows.

NICHOLSON

How the fuck could he know?

DIMES

He saw the wire.

NICHOLSON

How's he supposed to see the wire?

DIMES

He knows something's up.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts the .38 against Elliot's forehead.

CLARENCE

You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?

No answer.

CLARENCE

Don't you?

ELLIOT

(petrified)

No.

CLARENCE

(yelling)

Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON

We gotta get him outta there.

DIMES

Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE

Say it, goddamn it!

ELLIOT

You are the dumbest person in the world.

CLARENCE

Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.

ELLIOT

No. No you're not.

CLARENCE

What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.

BACK TO:

COPS

NICHOLSON

He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.

DIMES

This guy's gonna kill him.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE

Stand up.

Elliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.

CLARENCE

Like Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell me what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the first one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit making me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

DIMES

He's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.

NICHOLSON

Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.

DIMES

You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Elliot still hasn't answered.

CLARENCE

OK.

With the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what he's gonna do.

Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the other end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.

ELLIOT

I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come and get me 'cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be. And I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come and get me. 'Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but I just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything would be alright.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a "well, that's that" expression an their faces.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.

CLARENCE

Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal. I just hadda make sure you're all right. I'm sure. I really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, I'm just as scared as you. Friends?

Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand. Dick and Alabama are relieved.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Floyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw him.

There is a knock from the door.

FLOYD

(not turning away from TV)

It's open.

The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The door slams shut. All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd.

FLOYD

Yes.

LENNY

Are you Dick Ritchie?

FLOYD

No.

LENNY

Do you know a Clarence Worley?

FLOYD

Yes.

LENNY

Do you know where we can find him?

FLOYD

He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

LENNY

Where's that?

FLOYD

Well, you go down Beechwood...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty.

MONTY

Hi, Elliot. Are these your friends?

ELLIOT

You could say that. Everybody, this is Monty.

MONTY

C'mon in. Lee's in the can. He'll be out in a quick.

They all move into the room, it is very luxurious.

Another incredibly muscular GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he too has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down.

MONTY

Sorry, nothin personal.

He starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away.

CLARENCE

No need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre.

Boris gets up from the couch.

BORIS

What compelled you to bring that along?

CLARENCE

The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire weaponry to a business meeting.

BORIS

I'll take that.

CLARENCE

You'll have to.

The toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz emerges.

LEE

They're here. Who's who?

ELLIOT

Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and Alabama.

BORIS

(pointing at Clarence)

This guy's packin'.

LEE

Really?

CLARENCE

Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.

LEE

I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.

They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.

CLARENCE

Oh, Mr. Donowitz -

LEE

Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.

CLARENCE

OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.

LEE

Thank you very much, Clarence.

CLARENCE

You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

LEE

I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

CLARENCE

Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.

Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.

LEE

Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more than I do, but I wouldn't count on it.

Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.

CLARENCE

They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films. And do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like movies. "Mad Max", that's a movie. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", that's a movie. "Rio Bravo", that's a movie. "Rumble Fish", that's a fuckin' movie. And, "Coming Home in a Body Bag", that's a movie. It was the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the "The Deer Hunter".

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They're all listening to this.

DIMES

What's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the "New Yorker"?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE

My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film they'd ever seen.

LEE

You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you have for me.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

DIMES

Thank God.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Clarence puts the suitcase on the table.

CLARENCE

Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit.

BACK TO:

LOBBY

The four Wise-guys are at the desk.

LENNY

(quietly to the others)

What was the Jew-boy's name?

MARVIN

Donowitz, he said.

FRONT-DESK GUY

How can I help you, Gentlemen?

LENNY

Yeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.

CLARENCE

Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.

LEE

Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.

CLARENCE

Me too, Boris.

Boris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar. All eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this cup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.

LEE

(stirring loudly)

You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?

CLARENCE

I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

Both are cool as cucumbers.

LEE

I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris make anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in there.

ALABAMA

No thank you.

DICK

No. But thanks.

CLARENCE

No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.

LEE

Where'd you go?

CLARENCE

A Norms in Van Nuys.

LEE

Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.

Lee continues looking at the merchandise.

Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.

Lee looks up.

LEE

OK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the level.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

DIMES

If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.

NICHOLSON

Convince him.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE

Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with professionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world.

LEE

Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.

CLARENCE

Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.

(to Elliot)

Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.

(to Lee)

He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.

LEE

Why does he trust you?

CLARENCE

We grew up together.

LEE

If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?

CLARENCE

I bullshitted him.

Lee starts laughing.

LEE

That's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other room and get the money.

Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks.

DIMES & NICHOLSON

Bingo!

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

The four Wise-guys are coming up.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

LEE

(pointing to Alabama)

What's your part in this?

ALABAMA

I'm his wife.

LEE

(referring to Dick)

How 'bout you?

DICK

I know Elliot.

LEE

And Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend work in?

Dick and Alabama panic.

CLARENCE

(without missing a beat)

Carson County Sheriffs.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

The internal affairs officers high five.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.

LEE

Wanna count your money?

CLARENCE

Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They all stand.

DIMES

OK, boys. Let's go get 'em.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he starts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet and starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.

ELVIS

Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.

CLARENCE

I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.

ELVIS

All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.

CLARENCE

Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.

ELVIS

Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".

CLARENCE

That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Everything's just as it was.

Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with guns drawn.

DIMES & NICHOLSON

Police! Freeze, you're all under arrest!

Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.

DIMES

You two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.

MONTY

Fuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.

LEE

Monty, what are you talking about? So what they say.

DIMES

This is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!

BORIS

This is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it! Now get on the floor!

DICK

What the fuck am I doing here?

LEE

Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!

MONTY

So they're cops. Who gives a shit?

BORIS

Lee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.

NICHOLSON

OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't want it, and you don't want it.

LEE

We don't want it.

The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.

Half of the cops spin around.

WURLITZER

Freeze!

LENNY

Who are you guys?

WURLITZER

Police.

DARIO

(to Lenny)

Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops?

BACK TO:

BATHROOM

Clarence and Elvis.

CLARENCE

How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?

ELVIS

Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

CLARENCE

You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

ELVIS

You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.

CLARENCE

I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".

ELVIS

That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.

Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.

ELVIS

I like ya, Clarence. Always have.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with shotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns in the middle.

Dick's ready to pass out.

Alabama's so scared she pees on herself.

For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.

ELLIOT

Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes.

Dimes looks at Elliot.

ELLIOT

This has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just settle it by yourselves?

DIMES

Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!

LEE

(to Elliot)

How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit!

ELLIOT

Lee, understand, I didn't want to -

DIMES

Shut the fuck up!

LEE

Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty years 'cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn your SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the heart!

Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,

Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.

Alabama screams.

Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.

DIMES

(screaming)

Cody!!!

Nicholson flies backwards.

Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks back and forth then on the floor.

Clarence opens the bathroom door.

Dimes hits the ground firing.

A shot catches Clarence in the forehead.

Alabama screams.

Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror.

It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover.

Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.

Boris dives into the kitchen area.

Monty tips the table over.

Marvin dives behind the sofa.

Dario runs out of the door and down the hall.

With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA Officers are shot right away.

Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.

Elliot gets it from both sides.

Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom.

Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.

Alabama continues crawling.

Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.

The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.

As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY

Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.

BACK TO:

GUNFIGHT

Alabama crawling.

The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air. Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air. White powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.

Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.

An IA Officer goes after him.

Lenny makes a break for it.

Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.

Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.

ALABAMA

Sweety?

Clarence's face is awash with blood.

CLARENCE

I... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...

He dies.

Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - DAY

Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.

He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY

The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner.

IA OFFICER

(aiming gun)

Freeze!

Dick does.

DICK

I'm unarmed!

IA OFFICER

Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!

He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer, sending him to the wall.

DICK

Oh shit.

He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall.

Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.

Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.

DICK

Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm sorry.

Two elevator doors on either side of them open.

Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:

LENNY

Lotsa luck.

Lenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors close.

BACK TO:

HOTEL ROOM

The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down.

Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen.

In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times.

ALABAMA

Wake up, goddamn it!

Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy.

Boris peeks around the wall to fire.

Dimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.

BORIS

(off)

I'm shot! Stop!

DIMES

Throw out your gun, asshole!

The Uzi's tossed out.

Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.

DIMES

(to Marvin)

OK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down on the floor or die like all you friends.

The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY

Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the fourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.

HALLWAY

He starts trying the room doors for an open one.

DICK

Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up again. Please, just let me get to "T.J. Hooker" on Monday.

STEWARDESS'S ROOM - DAY

Dick steps in. Three gorgeous girls are doing a killer aerobics workout to a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.

LEE'S ROOM

Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen floor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.

DIMES

Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.

Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.

Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.

Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying over him.

Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer.

DIMES

Everything's under control here.

WURLITZER

Sorry about Nicholson.

DIMES

Me too.

WURLITZER

I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.

DIMES

You do that.

Wurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.

LOBBY

Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.

A Cop yells out.

COP You! Stop!

Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. Other cops rush forward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.

LENNY

Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!

LEE'S ROOM

Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back. Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying:

CLARENCE

(off)

She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.

Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.

Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.

She sees Boris on the kitchen floor.

ALABAMA

Bye-bye, Boris. Good luck.

BORIS

You too, cutie.

She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and walks out the door.

HALLWAY

The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.

Alabama comes around the corner.

WURLITZER

Hey, you!

Alabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the doors close.

LOBBY

Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.

LENNY

I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!

(pause)

Small bills!

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY

Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives away.

INT. MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY

Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be funny. She's muttering to herself.

ALABAMA

I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip. Goose egg. Nil. Donut.

The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues. She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.

She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool".

She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt. Fury" comic book Clarence bought her.

And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.

FADE OUT

THE END
